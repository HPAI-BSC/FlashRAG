Flow separation and turbulence, which cause unwanted signal losses and overestimation of stenoses on bright-blood MRA, paradoxically improve image quality on dark-blood MRA. Because intraluminal signal is suppressed, vessels containing \"black blood\" do not generate pulsation (ghosting) artifacts. Additionally, the lack of intraluminal signal allows the walls of vessels (or cardiac chambers) to be clearly delineated. For these reasons, dark-blood techniques are predominantly used in cardiac imaging and for evaluation of diseases of the vessel wall (atherosclerotic plaque and dissection). Although an excellent method for imaging high-flow vessels, dark-blood techniques are less sensitive to slower flow states. \"Black\" blood is difficult to separate from adjacent low-signal non-vascular structures, such as calcifications, cortical bone, and air."}}

The precise number of dummy cycles depends on the TR and the sequence chosen. Only once the system is near equilibrium does data collection begin."}}

By definition, 1/ΔT1 = r1 [C] and 1/ΔT2 = r2 [C]. Since ΔT1 and ΔT2 are given in seconds and [C] is measured in millimoles per liter, r1 and r2 have units of L/mmol-s."}}

Choice a) is the best choice. If the foreign body is embedded in soft tissue like the brain, even with scarring it can still move appreciably when placed in a magnetic field and cause appreciable local tissue damage. Conversely, fragments embedded in firm tissue like muscle, bone, or tendon, are less likely to move. The shape is important, as long jagged pieces are more dangerous than small round ones. And the longer it has been since injury, the more time has passed for development of scarring/fibrosis that would restrict movement in a magnetic field.  But location trumps shape and time in relative importance. Having been acquired in a military setting increases the probability that the fragment is ferromagnetic, but the question states you have already presumed this composition."}}

The SGP is strongest near the edges of the magnet bore opening, making this the most powerful place for translational forces (answer d is correct). At the magnet isocenter, however, dB/dz ≈ 0, so surprisingly there is no translational force once the object reaches the center of the magnet."}}

The answer is actually d), at a location slightly more posterior to the that of the spatial gradient or spatial gradient product. For an unsaturated object, torque is proportional to the square of the magnetic field (B²). So the torque is maximal where B is greatest. Most people assume this is in the center of the scanner, but for cylindrical magnets the local field is perhaps 10-20% higher just inside the bore opening along the inside walls of the scanner.

So by ASTM criteria any risk imposed by the application of the magnetically-induced deflection force is no greater than any risk imposed by normal daily activity in the Earth’s gravitational field.

The signal is coming from water protons, whose molecular rotation rates have been slowed to near the Larmor frequency by surface interactions with the calcium salts.  This rotational slowing results in short T1 and hence brightness on T1-weighted images."}}
