All manufactures use pre-emphasis or pre-compensation to correct for certain eddy current effects. This method does not eliminate or reduce eddy currents, but merely compensates for them. The technique involves purposely distorting the gradient driving currents, so that after eddy currents act, an output wave of the desired shape will be produced. Effect of eddy currents on gradient waveforms. If the input current is in the form of a rectangular pulse, eddy currents will distort the output. To correct in advance for this distortion due to eddy currents, the input waveform is modified through the process known as \"pre-emphasis.\" The final output waveform is now of the desired shape. (Note: the waveform distortions have been grossly exaggerated for didactic purposes). Prior to the mid-1990's when active shielded gradients came into widespread use, pre-emphasis was the only method available to correct for eddy currents. In this not-so-distant era, eddy currents were a huge problem, with amplitudes up to 50% of the intended pulsed-gradient magnitude. Today, with active shielding, uncompensated eddy-current gradients have been reduced to the 1% level. Pre-emphasis techniques are still employed to ameliorate these much smaller (but still detrimental) effects.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-pre-emphasis.html"}

Detection of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the myocardium may be difficult when an indwelling ICD or pacemaker is present. Metal-containing CIEDs located 5-10 cm away from the heart can induce off-resonance shifts in the water center frequency of 2-6 kHz, rendering standard RF-inversion pulses ineffective. The signal from the myocardium is not properly inverted/nulled, resulting in hyperintense artifacts on LGE images that may obscure much of the heart. To overcome this limitation, Rashid et al utilized a wideband (3.8 kHz) adiabatic hyperbolic secant IR pulse to replace the \"standard\" 1.1kHz pulse at 1.5T with great success, and these results have now been extended to both 3-dimensional acquisitions and higher field strengths. Wideband LGE options are now commercially available on MR systems offered by the major vendors. Conventional (A) and Wideband (B) LGE images of patient with an ICD.

The approximate signal intensity ( S ) from an IR pulse sequence is given by the following equation: where K is a scaling factor and [ H ] is the spin density. S may be either positive or negative, depending on whether the tissue M z is pointing in the + z or  z direction at the end of the TI interval. When using magnitude-reconstructed IR (the most common method), the absolute value (|S|) should be used. For phase-corrected IR maintaining the sign of S is important, as + S values are displayed brighter than  S ones. The effect of TE is readily apparent, appearing in the multiplier term e TE/T2 . If TE is short compared to T2, the exponential term converges to unity and the T2 sensitivity is minimized. Conversely, if TE is the same or longer than T2, then this term becomes large and T2-weighting of the IR sequence is accentuated. The effects of TR and TI on image contrast are not immediately obvious. You will recall that in SE imaging, the TR value controls T1-weighting through a term of the form e TR/T1 . Even though there is a similar exponential term in the IR equation above, there is a second term ( 2e TI/T1 ) that also contains T1. In general, therefore, the TR value does not tightly control T1-weighting in IR sequences like it does in SE sequences. T1-weighting is primarily determined by the TI value selected. The only real adjustment needed for TR is to make sure it is long enough to allow enough slices to be acquired and sufficiently long to allow enough tissue recovery to generate a usable signal. We will cover how to select TI for various imaging scenarios in the next several Q&As. In particular we will see that judicious selection of TI will allow you to null the signal from a given tissue, such as fat, white matter, gray matter, or CSF as shown below. By judicious choice of TI, selective nulling of fat (STIR sequence, TI=180), white matter (TI=400), gray matter (TI=650) or CSF (T2-FLAIR, TI=2500) is possible.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/choice-of-ir-parameters.html"}

Passive shimming is a method of field correction involving the use of ferromagnetic materials, typically iron or steel, placed in a regular pattern at specific locations along the inner bore of the magnet. Sliding trays with metallic shims The most common design for cylindrical superconducting scanners involves the use of 12-24 trays arranged symmetrically around the circumference of the magnet. Each tray slides along the z-axis of the scanner and contains pockets into which a desired number of ferromagnetic shim elements can be placed. Passive shim trays (arrows) in a MR magnet during installation. The specific trays, slots, number, and size of shim elements to be inserted are determined by specialized shimming software used during the magnetic field mapping process (actual computer printout below). Field mapping is then repeated and the shims tweaked or adjusted as needed. Several iterations of this process may be required until the desired level of homogeneity is reached. Service engineer adjusting passive shims during magnet installation. By careful passive shimming excellent static homogeneity of the main magnetic field may be achieved. A disadvantage of this technique is that the shim material is temperature sensitive, and when the bore heats (as it commonly does with gradient-intensive sequences), field shifts may occur. Additionally, the shims may become magnetized over time, requiring replacement and/or repositioning. An even more significant limitation of passive shimming lies in the fact that it is a static solution created for an empty magnet. When a patient is placed within the scanner, additional field distortions result from diamagnetic susceptibility effects. Each patient therefore creates a unique pattern of inhomogeneity that can only be corrected through a dynamic process. Active shimming provides a method to correct for these individual variations in field from patient to patient.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/passive-shimming.html"}

This document classified SAR into various subtypes (shown in the table below) and established three modes of scanner operation based on perceived risk to subjects: 1) normal mode, 2) first-level controlled mode, and 3) second level controlled mode. Criteria for each operating mode are based principally around specific absorption rate (SAR) , but also include factors such as static field strength ( B o ) , rates of time-varying gradients ( dB/dt ), area of the body imaged, and temperature rise. These non -SAR criteria for various operating modes and supervisory requirements are discussed more completely in the next Q&A .

An analogy is often made to the well-recognized superiority of nonionic iodine -based contrast agents over ionic ones in terms of renal safety and adverse reactions. The (false) conclusion is that non-ionic gadolinium agents would likewise be better than ionic ones. Ionicity is closely related to osmolality (the number of dissolved particles per kg of water). A comparison of the gadolinium agents in clinical use are shown in the table right. As a point of reference, normal serum osmolality is approximately 290 mOsm/kg, so even non-ionic contrast agents are still significantly hypertonic with respect to blood. A close tracking between ionicity and high osmolality is noted. The only exception on the table is Gadavist, which although non-ionic has high osmolality. This is the result of the manufacturer's decision to dispense this drug in a concentration twice as high as the other agents. The net charge of the gadolinium ion plus its ligand controls the compound's osmolality. As an example, let us consider the venerable Gd-DTPA anionic portion of Magnevist with net charge of 2. To attain electroneutrality, two meglumine cations (each with charge +1) are attached to the salt. When dissolved in solution three osmotically active particles are released, explaining why Magnevist has an osmolality of roughly three times higher than a non-ionic agent like ProHance. The obvious method to make a gadolinium contrast agent non-ionic is to attach a ligand whose charge is 3. This will balance out the +3 charge of the Gd ion and make the molecule electrically neutral. By toggling through the slide show left, you can see how manufacturers have modified various ligand to achieve electroneutrality for several commercially used contrast agents. The same process can be applied to both linear and macrocyclic agents. So, does ionicity/osmolality matter in selection of a Gd-contrast agent? Three clinical scenarios must be considered where a difference might be important: 1) subcutaneous extravasation of contrast; 2) potential nephrotoxicity; and 3) problems related to acute increase in serum osmolality. Tissue irritation from extravasation is somewhat more severe when hyperosmolar contrast is used. Because gadolinium agents are injected in such low volumes (10-15 cc), however, even large fraction extravasations of either type of agent do not generally create significant injury. In my opinion, the slightly better performance of low osmolar/non-ionic agents in this dimension should not outweigh other factors in selection of a contrast material. A similar conclusion can be drawn concerning possible acute renal toxicity . By the time contrast has circulated through the heart and aorta, its concentration has been significantly diluted. Thus, whatever mild nephrotoxic effects gadolinium contrast may possess (see separate Q&A ), the difference between ionic and nonionic formulations is probably minimal. Systemic osmolar effects of gadolinium contrast are not likely to be significant for a similar reason. The osmolar effect of a contrast agent is determined not by its concentration in the bottle, but by its concentration in the blood. The systemic concentration of a contrast agent depends on its total osmotic load, which is the drug's pharmaceutical osmolality times the volume administered. For example, the total osmolar load from a 15-cc dose of Magnevist is (1940) x (0.015), or 29 mOsm, whereas the osmolar load from the same dose of ProHance would be (630) x (0.015), or 9 mOsm. Administration of these drugs would increase serum osmolality by only 1.5% and 0.5% respectively. Iodinated agents, however, are administered in much larger volumes, so that their systemic osmolar effects are much greater. For example, the total osmolar load from 150 cc of Renografin-60 (osmolality, 1420 mOsm/L) is calculated to be 213 mOsm, whereas the osmolar load from 150 cc of the non-ionic agent Isovue-300 (osmolality, 616 mOsm/L) is 92 mOsm. Serum osmolality would potentially increase by 12% and 5% respectively from administration of these iodine-based agents. This quantitative example demonstrates that even the most ionic gadolinium agents produce a trivial change in serum osmolality, an effect far less than even a non-ionic iodine agent. The difference between ionic and nonionic gadolinium agents in terms of their systemic osmotic effects is therefore hardly noticeable.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ionic-v-non-ionic.html"}

Susceptibility (  ) is a measure of the extent a substance becomes magnetized when placed in an external magnetic field. Materials that disperse the main field are called diamagnetic . Materials that concentrate the field are called paramagnetic , superparamagnetic , or ferromagnetic , depending on the magnitude of the effect. Calcium salts (as found in cortical bone) are the most strongly diamagnetic substances in the human body. Nearly all biological tissues (muscle, fat, brain, liver, water) are also diamagnetic, but weakly so. Surprisingly, air is not susceptibility neutral but is slightly paramagnetic due to the presence of molecular oxygen. The presence of metallic ions (Fe, Mn, Gd) in tissues produces weak paramagnetism. Globular microscopic accumulations of iron as seen in ferritin and hemosiderin particles create an even stronger positive susceptibility effect known as superparamagnetism. The most powerful magnetic field susceptibilities occur in solid metal objects containing Fe, Co, or Ni (such as prosthesis, surgical clips, and screws) and is called ferromagnetism. The magnetic field distortions created by susceptibility effects result in variations in precessional frequency across the patient and even within individual voxels. These frequency changes, in turn, produce signal loss from T2*-dephasing and spatial mismapping of the MR signal. The MR imaging characteristics reflect both of these physical mechanisms: geometric distortion with focal areas of signal void and regions of very bright signal resulting from \"piling up\" signal assigned to the wrong areas. A gallery of various susceptibility artifacts is provided below (click on any picture to enlarge and read caption). Since ferromagnetic materials have the largest susceptibilities, field distortions and MR artifacts are usually prominent around metal objects and implants. More subtle susceptibility distortions may be seen at natural interfaces (e.g., trabecular bone, paranasal sinuses, skull base, and sella). The shape (diffuse or focal) and intensity (high or low) of the artifact depend on local anatomic relationships, field strength, difference in susceptibilities, echo time ( TE ) as well as bandwidth (or readout gradient strength and direction) as expressed to the relationship: Because susceptibility artifacts are worse at high fields, we avoid scanning patients with metal implants at 3.0 T whenever possible. Susceptibility artifacts may be changed in shape, but not eliminated, by altering the directions of frequency- and phase-encoding. They can be minimized by using shorter TE values (less time for dephasing) and by using fast spin-echo instead of gradient-echo sequences. Susceptibility artifacts can also be reduced by increasing gradient strength for a given field-of-view and avoiding narrow bandwidth techniques. Thinner slices also help as do the use of parallel imaging techniques. The more severe metal artifacts may be reduced by specific metal artifact reduction pulse sequences (discussed in the next Q&A ).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/susceptibility-artifact.html"}

Breast cancer DCE breast imaging faces several challenges not present to the same extent in other parts of the body: 1) requirement to detect very small lesions in a (potentially) large volume of tissue; 2) measurement of contrast enhancement within a background of T1-bright fat; and 3) noise from respiratory and cardiac motion. The major MR manufacturers have developed breast-optimized 3D T1-weighted gradient echo sequences known under different acronyms. These sequences all include some type of fat suppression. Typical imaging parameters are TR = 4-6 ms, TE = 1-3 ms, and flip angles = 10-15. Dedicated multichannel breast coils with parallel imaging must be used. As with all DCE studies, a trade-off exists between spatial and temporal resolution. Due to the small size of potential tumors, the minimum spatial resolution requirements for breast DCE are an in-plane resolution of  1 mm  and a slice thickness  3 mm with no gaps. At present, DCE analysis of breast tumors is primarily observational and semi-quantitative. Temporal resolution between phases of 1 2 minutes is therefore acceptable. Type II DCE enhancement pattern in a breast mass (Courtesy Philips) Tumor MR enhancement patterns Both patterns of contrast uptake and estimated wash-in/wash-out rates from a lesion can provide clues as to its nature. A popular classification scheme by Kuhl et al. based on the shape of the contrast-time intensity curves is illustrated above. Breast masses with progressive uptake of contrast (Type I pattern) are more likely to be benign, whereas those with rapid uptake and wash-out (Type III) are more likely to be malignant. Lesions demonstrating plateau enhancement (Type II pattern) are intermediate. This classification scheme has also been applied to tumors in other organs, including the liver and prostate.

Network/graph theory  used to analyze such diverse systems as telecommunications, computer circuitry, social organizations, and the internet  has become an increasingly popular method for describing functional and anatomic connectivity in the brain. Although one step removed from classic MR physics, network/graph analysis seems poised to become a pre-eminent method for fMRI analysis, so a brief introduction to some of its concepts may be useful. The initial step in network analysis is to define nodes (or vertices ): identifiable brain regions thought to function homogeneously in a given experiment. Nodes may be as small as individual voxels, but are more typically somewhat larger anatomic units (such as gyri, nuclei, or areas with a common cytoarchitecture). A link (or edge ) joins two nodes that have correlated activity (by fMRI, EEG, MEG, etc.) or a direct physical connection (e.g., from neuroanatomy or diffusion tensor tractography). A network with nodes and links may be represented either graphically or as a numerical array. The latter is known as an adjacency matrix , where each element ( e ij ) is a number reflecting the strength of the link between nodes i and j . A path is an ordered sequence of links connecting two nodes, whose length is defined as the number of links. Some paris of nodes may be connected by several paths with different lengths. The average length of the shortest paths for all node pairs in a network is called the characteristic path length , a metric inversely related to communication efficiency. Connection density is the ratio of actual number of links to the total number of possible links and is often used as an estimator for energy expenditure, resource utilization, or other physical \"cost\" of the network. In a complex system like the brain some nodes will be extensively interconnected while others may remain relatively isolated. The number of connections a node has with the rest of the network is called its degree . A node with a large number of connections is called a hub and said to have a high centrality . Such nodes are often essential to efficient communication in the network. A cluster refers to a small group of connected nearest neighbor nodes. The smallest cluster is a triangle (3 nodes). Many networks contain smaller subnetworks known as modules . which may be organized hierarchially . The clustering coefficient relates the number of clusters to the size of the entire network. Efficient and complex networks typically have a high degree of clustering. Many brain networks also demonstrate 'small-world' organization . The small-world concept takes origin from social networks and the phenomenon that even strangers on far sides of the earth can be connected by a relatively small number of mutual acquaintances. Small world networks are characterized by many hubs, high degrees of local clustering, and short path lengths globally linking all the network nodes. Thus, e ven though most nodes maintain only a limited number of direct connections in cliques , all nodes of the system can be accessed through a relatively small number of intermediate steps. At present it is not certain which of the many possible network descriptors and metrics listed above will prove most useful, but preliminary studies in disorders such as Alzheimer disease, autism spectrum, and schizophrenia have already identified changes in brain organization identifiable through network measures.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/networkgraphs.html"}

Adiabatic pulses are a class of amplitude- and frequency-modulated RF-pulses that are relatively insensitive to B 1 inhomogeneity and frequency offset effects. They utilize the adiabatic principle explained in the previous Q&A wherein magnetization ( M ) is manipulated by a slow passage of the B 1 field through resonance. With adiabatic pulses spins having different resonant frequencies are inverted or manipulated at different times. This differs from an \"ordinary\" amplitude modulated rectangular RF-pulse where all spins are affected simultaneously. Additional advantages of adiabatic pulses include: 1) Less sensitive to RF miscalibration and hence have a high tolerance to field inhomogeneity; 2) accurate spin manipulation over a large range of RF power levels; and 3) minimization of sample heating and specific absorption rate (SAR) . Adiabatic pulses can be categorized as excitation, refocusing, and inversion pulses. No matter what their use, adiabatic pulses behave differently than non-adiabatic pulses. For example, the flip angle produced is not simply proportional to B 1 magnitude and pulse length, but depends on how the B 1 field varies in amplitude and phase throughout the pulse. Likewise, adiabatic pulses cannot be simply scaled or stretched to change their effect; doubling a 90  adiabatic pulse does not produce a 180  inversion pulse. The design of adiabatic pulses is rather complex, often segmentally constructed out of hyperbolic tangent or secant functions, with independent amplitude and frequency (or phase) modulation.

DCE imaging data can be evaluated by one of three methods: simple visual assessment, semi-quantitative descriptive indices, or model-based quantification. Simple visual assessment of contrast enhancement at various time points is the method most widely used by clinical radiologists. Inspection begins by looking for areas in the dynamic series where contrast appears first. Both patterns of contrast uptake and estimated wash-in/wash-out rates from a lesion can provide clues as to its nature. Different portions of a dynamic contrast enhancement curve reflects different anatomic and physiological features. The initial steep upslope of the curve correlates with tissue blood flow and its peak height reflects total blood flow and volume. The next portion of the curve is due to contrast leakage into the tissue interstitium and thus is a function of capillary area and permeability. Late portions of the curve reflect the total tissue extracellular space and plasma interstitial volume. Contributions to total contrast enhancement as a function of time Semi-quantitative descriptive indices from the raw signal intensity data can also be applied to this data, similar to those used for DSC imaging . Such parameters may include arrival time (AT), time to peak (TTP), wash-in rate (WIR), wash-out rate (WOR), area under contrast curve (AUC), maximum enhancement (ME), and percent maximum enhancement (%ME) compared to baseline. Although the absolute values of these indices are meaningless, they may be useful when compared to signal intensity changes in other lesions or to the normal tissue background. Full quantitative analysis of the DCE data requires three steps: 1) conversion of signal intensity to gadolinium concentration; 2) selection of an appropriate tissue model; and 3) estimation of model parameters from the fitted data. Potentially important quantitative tissue parameters obtainable include vascular permeability, gadolinium exchange rates, blood flow, and volume of the tissue extracellular space.

FOV = 15 cm FOV = 20 cm FOV = 30 cm This method cannot be exercised with impunity, however, for if the FOV is increased, spatial resolution will suffer. To maintain spatial resolution, therefore, the number of phase-encoding steps must be increased. Phase wrap-around will be eliminated, but at the cost of increased imaging time. As an alternative strategy, the frequency- and phase-encoding axes may be swapped so that the shorter dimension of the subject is oriented in the phase-encode direction. If the field-of-view is very small, however, even the shorter anatomic dimension of the subject may still exceed the field-of-view, and phase wrap-around will still occur. Additionally, switching phase and frequency may introduce different unwanted artifacts over the image (such as motion-induced phase ghosts or chemical-shift artifacts), thus limiting the usefulness of this simple strategy. Another group of techniques eliminates phase wrap-around by minimizing the signal from the tissue outside the field-of-view. These techniques include using a surface coil (which doesn't detect signals far away from it) and applying saturation pulses outside the field-of-view (to eliminate the signal from tissues there). Finally, \"phase oversampling\" or \"no-phase-wrap\" techniques are available that largely eliminate the phase wrap-around artifact in most cases. These techniques are the subject of the next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/eliminate-wrap-around.html"}

As Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) has become increasingly more sophisticated, most centers have developed a relatively large number of imaging protocols tailored to specific clinical indications. As an overview, these may be divided in morphology, function, and viability studies. Morphology (Anatomy) Anatomic images of the heart and great vessels are a standard part of nearly every CMR examination. Such views are, of course, essential in patients with complex congenital malformations, but are needed even in morphologically \"normal\" patients due natural variability in heart size, position, and rotation. In addition to conventional (axial, coronal, or sagittal views), several special oblique planes of imaging are routinely obtained for most cardiac studies. These may include long axis, short axis, and views of the valves, coronary arteries, and great vessels. Long-axis 4-chamber view Short-axis view 3 chamber LV outflow tract view Rt coronary artery view \"Candy cane\" view of aorta LV outflow tract view Two types of sequences are commonly used for morphologic imaging: dark blood and bright blood . Both are typically performed at multiple slice locations during diastole, producing a stack of images covering the relevant anatomy in 4-5 mm sections. Dark (\"black\") blood sequences are utilize Inversion recovery (IR) prepulses to null the signal from blood alone (double IR), or from both blood and fat (triple IR). Rapid signal generation is usually based upon variants of the HASTE (Half-Fourier Acquisition Single-shot Turbo spin Echo) technique. Bright blood sequences are typically based on b-SSFP (balanced Steady-State Free Precession) methods, perhaps better known by their vendor-specific nomenclature: TrueFISP (Siemens), FIESTA (GE), or b-FFE (Philips). These sequences reflect the relatively high T2/T1 ratio of blood. Cardiac Function (Motion) SSFP-based bright-blood images of the beating heart are essential for displaying cardiac function and are part of nearly every CMR examination. The motion of the ventricular walls during systole and diastole is of fundamental interest; this can be assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Additional information about valve function is also possible. The turbulence created by valvular stenosis or insufficiency creates loss of signal in the bright blood in proportion to its severity. SSFP cine cardiac function study Cine studies are obtained by repeatedly imaging the heart at a single slice location throughout the cardiac cycle. Between 16 and 32 cardiac phases are usually sampled and displayed in a movie loop. Data collection takes place over multiple cardiac cycles using retrospective EKG-gating and breath-holding. In sick or uncooperative patients, real-time cine images may be obtained in just a few milliseconds without breath-holding, but suffer from decreased spatial and temporal resolution. Myocardial Viability/Perfusion Myocardial viability is assessed using gadolinium-enhanced imaging. The standard methods utilize segmented, T1-weighted, inversion-prepared fast gradient echo sequences. The inversion time ( TI ) is chosen to null signal from myocardium, typically in the range of 250-350 ms at 1.5T. Precontrast images are first obtained followed by injection of half-dose gadolinium with first-pass perfusion imaging. An additional half- dose of gadolinium is then injected, with delayed images obtained at 10 and 20 minutes. Delayed enhancement is characteristic of subacute myocardial infarction, but also a number of other diseases. Delayed enhancement (arrow) in apical infarction The sensitivity of gadolinium-enhanced CMR can be improved by combining first pass cine perfusion and delayed imaging in conjunction with pharmacological stress testing. In the past dobutamine was commonly used for this purpose, but now it has been largely replaced by adenosine or regadenoson. You may find the YouTube videos and references below helpful in providing more information about the types of CMR pulse sequences available. These techniques will also be thoroughly explored in multiple subsequent Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/cardiac-protocols.html"}

The human body has no effective mechanism for eliminating excess iron. Patients with thalassemia and transfusion-related anemias may develop systemic iron overload, with deposition of iron species in the heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, and gonads. End-organ damage results from the formation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation. Clinical monitoring of systemic iron overload is important as chelation therapy may improve prognosis in these patients. Focal tissue accumulations of superparamagnetic hemosiderin and ferritin create local susceptibility -induced distortions in the magnetic field. These cause the transverse magnetization to decay much faster than would be predicted by natural atomic and molecular mechanisms (\"true\" T2). This \"observed\" or \"effective\" T2 value is denoted T2* (\"T2-star\") . T2* is thus always less than or equal to T2. The values for T2 and T2* are connected by the relationship where 1/T2 i =   B i is the relaxation rate contribution attributable to field inhomogeneities ( B i ) across a voxel. Note that the equation is a sum of relaxation rates (1/T2's) rather than relaxation times (T2's). T2*-weighted MRI is a well-validated predictor of both cardiac and hepatic iron content and superior to noninvasive methods such as measurement of serum ferritin. Several methods of estimating T2* values are possible, but the most common technique is to acquire a series of breath-hold gradient-echo (GRE) images at progressively increasing echo times ( TE's ) as shown below: Measurements of signal intensity are made over the ventricular septum (thus avoiding susceptibility artifacts from cardiac veins and air-containing lung). After subtracting background noise, the signal intensity curve is fitted to a simple exponential resulting in an estimate of myocardial T2*. Multi-echo GRE images of the liver are also usually acquired at the same setting, allowing hepatic T2* values to be computed. The degree of iron overload present in the liver or heart is often qualitatively characterized using a scale similar to that below. Semiautomated T2* mapping is available several independent companies, such as that from Medis above. Estimation of T2* using signal intensity ( SI ) data at different TE's fitted to a 1st order exponential model.

At least 6 different artifacts are commonly noted in time-of-flight (TOF) MRA studies. These are illustrated and briefly discussed below: Stair-Step Artifact (2D TOF only) This simplest form of this artifact is a subtle pixelated appearance to obliquely oriented vessels. This occurs because the slices in 2D are relatively thick (1-3 mm) compared to the in-plane spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 mm. Stair-step artifacts can be minimized by overlapping slices by 25-30%. This means more slices are needed to cover the same area, however, with a concomitant increase in scan time. Mild \"stair-step\" artifact due to non-isotropic voxels More severe stair-step artifacts occur when subtle or gross motion occurs between the individually acquired 2D slices. Mild motion artifact causing horizontal banding on this 2D-TOF MRA of the aorta Severe artifacts with jagged edges due to gross motion for carotid TOF MRA study In-Plane Saturation Artifact TOF MRA relies on the inflow of fresh (unsaturated) blood to produce high intravascular signal. This signal is highest whenever the direction of flow is perpendicular to the primary imaging plane. When vessels travel within plane, their blood may become saturated like stationary tissues, resulting in decreased signal. This may occur with either 2D or 3D TOF techniques. 3D-TOF MRA showing artifactual in-plane signal loss within both middle cerebral arteries 2D-TOF MRA shows artifactual in-plane signal loss in horizontal portions of both anterior tibial arteries Shine-through Artifacts Both 2D and 3D TOF MR angiographic images are displayed using a maximum intensity projection (MIP) algorithm. The MIP selects all pixels having an arbitrary minimum signal intensity (e.g., 2 standard deviations above background). In addition to bright blood vessels, any other material with high signal intensity will \"shine through\" and \"contaminate\" the MIP image. Since underlying TOF MRA pulse sequences are T1-weighted, short T1 materials (hematoma, gadolinium, fat) are primarily responsible for this phenomenon. However, any high signal focus (due to motion or susceptibility) could create problems in interpretation. 3D TOF MRA showing shine through of high signal from hematoma (H) and fat (F) at skull base CSF inflow phenomenon (on source image below) creates artifact on MIP image (above) Flow-Reversal Artifact This is more of a pitfall rather than an artifact, but an important one of which to be aware. Recall that TOF techniques typically employ traveling saturation pulses to eliminate signal from veins flowing in the opposite direction. But what happens if an artery has retrograde flow due to some abnormal condition? Yes, it will be suppressed as well and not seen on the TOF MRA. An example is shown below of a patient with subclavian steal syndrome that causes flow in the left vertebral artery to be reversed. Similar phenomena may be seen in the pelvis and lower extremities where collaterals around stenotic lesions may follow a retrograde course. 2D TOF MRA shows only right vertebral artery. No flow related signal in the left vertebral artery is seen. Contrast-enhanced MRA shows retrograde filling of left vertebral artery (subclavian steal phenomenon) Venetian Blind Artifact (3D MRA only) This is a specific artifact seen only with the MOTSA (Multiple Overlapping Thin Slab Acquisition) technique. It represents overlap between adjacent slabs that are acquired as separate acquisitions and then fused together. The MOTSA technique is described in more detail in another Q&A . Susceptibility Artifacts Susceptibility refers to the magnetic field distortion that occurs especially at air-tissue interfaces and near metallic objects. These distortions create magnetic gradients that cause accelerated dephasing of spins, signal loss, and spatial distortion. In MRA susceptibility artifacts are commonly encountered around surgical clips, endovascular coils, and stents. When mild, these artifacts may suggest vascular narrowing or stenosis when none exists. When severe they may cause complete loss of flow-related enhancement falsely suggesting occlusion.

{"id": "72d0f0f5-70b0-4461-a4cf-07a9107bf465", "contents": "Key Physical Properties What are the important physical properties to consider when choosing a contrast agent? The table below lists several key physical properties of commercially-available gadolinium-based contrast media that should be considered when selecting an agent. In this and other tables I have used the brand names rather than chemical names since these will likely be more familiar to readers. Physical and pharmacologic properties of the commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents 1. Osmolality . Osmolality reflects the concentration of dissolved particles in a contrast agent's formulation. Values range between 630 and 1970 mOsm/kg of water where 1 mOsm = 1 \"milli-osmole\" = 1 / 1000 of a mole. The osmolality of a contrast agent is closely related to whether it is ionic or non-ionic. The clinical differences between low and high osmolality gadolinium agents is not nearly as important as differences between similar classes of iodine-based agents. (See ionic/non-ionic Q&A ). 2. Viscosity . Viscosity is a measure of the \"thickness\" and internal resistance to motion of a fluid. For contrast agents the units are typically given in centiPoise (cP), where 1 cP = 1 g/m-s. The viscosities of contrast agents are in a range similar to that of whole blood with minor differences among them. Generally viscosity is not a major concern for standard doses and injection rates, but could be important for small caliber IVs and rapid injections. 3. Thermodynamic stability . The equilibrium constant ( K therm ) is an important parameter to note as it reflects how tightly the Gd ion is bound to its ligand. This value is presented on a logarithmic scale, with larger values representing exponentially tighter binding. It is no coincidence that the contrast agent with the lowest K therm (Omniscan) has been associated with the highest reported rate of associated nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) , a disease believed due to the deposition of free Gd in tissues. Selecting an agent with a high K therm is especially important in patients with renal insufficiency who are at risk for NSF. The structure of the ligand (linear vs macrocyclic) is also important, as less free gadolinium in tissues has been recorded for the macrocyclic agents independent of the K therm . The video below explains these concepts in a little more detail. 4. Relaxivity . Relaxivity is a measure of the degree to which a given amount of contrast agent shortens T1 or T2. This is obviously a very important metric as accelerated relaxation is the main purpose of administering contrast! Higher values are better. Higher relaxivities are associated with larger ligands and the propensity of the agent to bind with serum proteins. Gadopiclenol (Vueway/Elucirem  ) is an exception, as it has fairly large ligands but little protein binding. 5. Elimination half-life . Extracellular gadolinium contrast agents all share a common pharmacology. Within minutes of intravenous injection, they distribute rapidly throughout the extracellular interstitium. They are not metabolized and nearly completely eliminated by passive renal filtration, resulting in an biological half-life of approximately 1 hours in patients with normal renal function. The elimination half-life is shortest for Eovist due to its combined renal and hepatobiliary excretion. 6. Dose . The recommended dose of all gadolinium contrast agents is given on a per kilogram basis. The standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg for most agents, the only exceptions being for Eovist dosed at 0.025 mmol/kg and Vueway/Elucirem  dosed at 0.05 mmol/kg.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/important-properties.html"}

Hunter's angle is a visual method for assessing the relative peak heights of the major metabolites on a brain MR spectrum. It is named after Dr. Hunter Sheldon, a neurosurgeon at California's Huntington Medical Research Institutes. According to written accounts, Dr. Sheldon was viewing a normal MRS study one day when he took out his pocket comb and placed it along the tips of the three largest spectral peaks (Cho, Cre, and NAA). These peaks were approximately collinear and formed an angle of about 45 with the horizontal. Since that time, Hunter's angle (or line) has been used as a quick, semiquantitative method for assessing whether an MRS spectrum is normal or abnormal. Hunter's line at a 45 angle connecting the 3 major peaks of a normal MR spectrum (Choline, Creatine, and n-acetyl-aspartate) at short TE = 30 ms. A fourth peak, myo-Inositol, often falls on this line as well. It is merely happenstance that the three largest peaks Dr. Sheldon observed were approximately collinear and formed a 45-angle, although it is true that in normal brain tissue the concentrations of the three metabolites do follow the order Cho < Cr < NAA. In many brain tumors and other pathology with high membrane turnover, Cho is relatively increased and NAA is decreased, disrupting this relationship and causing a dip or peak in Hunter's line. Although a straight-line 45 Hunter's angle may be used to support normality in a spectrum, it works well only under the limited conditions where it was first described (STEAM MRS technique with short TE in the supratentorial adult brain). Hunter's angle is a very unreliable sign of disease in most other circumstances, including the more commonly used long TE PRESS sequences, short or long TE spectroscopy of the basal ganglia or posterior fossa, and in newborns or young infants.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/hunters-angle.html"}

Two steps are required to uniquely excite a slice in 2D MR imaging: (1) a slice-select gradient is imposed along an axis perpendicular to the plane of the desired slice, resulting in a linear variation of potential resonance frequencies in that direction, and (2) a specially tailored RF-pulse is simultaneously applied, whose frequency components match the narrow range of frequencies contained in the desired slice. The combination of steps (1) and (2) insures that only protons within the chosen slice are excited. Magnetic field gradient causes the center frequency ( F c ) of each slice to vary by position. The range of frequencies ( F ) contained in a slice depends on slice thickness ( F ) and the strength of the gradient ( G ss ). Each slice has a different center frequency F c determined by its position ( z ) along the slice-select gradient ( G ss ), given by F c = (B o + z G ss ) = f o +   z G ss where B o is the main magnetic field strength and f o is its corresponding Larmor frequency. Each slice has a finite width ( z ) and so it contains a range of frequencies ( F ) centered around F c . These quantities are related by the equation F =   G ss  z In common practice F is held constant (on the order of 1000-2000 Hz) and slice thickness z is varied by adjusting G ss . Stronger gradients produce thinner slices, and vice versa. The frequency-encoding gradient thus uniquely identifies a slice using center frequency ( F c ) to determine slice position and frequency span ( F ) to determine slice thickness ( z ). The next step is to stimulate the slice with an RF-pulse that will excite uniformly that particular band of frequencies and no others. Mathematically it can be shown that the ideal RF-excitation to achieve this frequency profile is a so-called sinc pulse . The sinc pulse is an amplitude-modulated sine wave with base frequency F c whose equation is given below Here the range of frequencies ( F ) subtending a slice equals the transmit bandwidth of the pulse. Transmitter bandwidth should be distinguished from receiver bandwidth (discussed in a prior Q&A ). Receiver BW is function of the digitization rate of the recorded MR signal and has nothing to do with slice selection. Idealized multi-lobe sinc pulse Truncated sinc with two side lobes obtained by author from his own scanner. Only the envelope of the pulse is seen as the 64 MHz carrier wave cannot be resolved at this setting of the oscilloscope. A sinc pulse would require an infinite number of side lobes (and hence infinite transmission time) to uniformly and exclusively excite a discrete band of frequencies. In practice the sinc pulse is modified by a process known as apodization (literally cutting off the \"feet\", limiting the number of side lobes and changing their shape by digital filtering). Other pulse shapes, including those with a Gaussian envelope, are also used. Today most RF-pulses cannot be described by mathematically simple waveforms, having eclectic shapes based on an computer-based polynomial design process known as the Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) algorithm . SLR-generated pulses provide more careful control of RF phase properties, allowing the designer to trade off analytically several parameters describing pulse performance including frequency profile, ripple, duration, and energy deposition. Examples of two 90 SLR pulses. In red, a linear phase SLR pulse resembling the classic sinc pulse. In blue, an SLR pulse that minimizes phase dispersions due to flow.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/slice-selective-excitation.html"}

Immediately after hemorrhage begins, an expanding hematoma contains liquid (plasma) and solid (cellular) elements similar in composition and MR properties to blood within the vascular system. Components of whole blood Plasma is over 95% water with some dissolved proteins (albumin, globulins, fibrinogen) and lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides). These macromolecules give plasma its yellowish color and produce mild shortening of relaxation times. At 1.5T the T1 and T2 values of plasma are approximately 2300 and 400 msec, respectively. The solid elements of fresh blood are primarily erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) , with small contributions from leukocytes and platelets. Erythrocytes contain the oxygen-transporting, iron-containing protein hemoglobin (Hb) . Hemoglobin may exist in several distinct chemical forms with markedly different magnetic properties. The state of Hb is thus a powerful determinant of the MR appearance of the solid portions of hematomas at all stages. Molecular oxygen reversibly binds to a coordination site for iron in each heme unit, resulting in either oxyhemoglobin or deoxyhemoglobin. In arterial blood, over 95% of hemoglobin is in the oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) state, while less than 5% is deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) . In venous blood, oxy-Hb still predominates, though in a smaller ratio (venous oxy:deoxy  70:30.) Oxy-Hb is weakly diamagnetic as the bonding of oxygen results in a configuration around the heme iron with no unpaired electrons. Deoxy-Hb, however, has 4 unpaired electrons per iron atom and is strongly paramagnetic. The volume fraction of RBCs ( hematocrit ) within a hematoma is also important. In normal adults, the hematocrit of circulating blood is in the range of 40-50%, with variations by age, sex, and altitude. As RBCs in a developing hematoma settle by gravity and begin to stick together during clotting, the local hematocrit may increase to 90% or more. Increasing hematocrit has three effects: Decreased \"free\" water content, reducing T1, T2 and spin density Decreased extracellular space, restricting diffusion Increased concentration of Hb, potentiating T2/T2* paramagnetic shortening by deoxy-Hb The hyperacute phase is often arbitrarily defined to be the first 12 hours after the onset of hemorrhage. Regardless of whether the blood source is arterial or venous, oxy-Hb will the dominant initial chemical species present. Clotting begins, and plasma is converted to serum as coagulation factors are consumed. Occasionally a peripheral halo of serum may be seen around the centrally contracting clot. Rarely, a RBC-serum fluid level may be observed before clotting is complete. Dexoy-Hb formation starts to occur around the hematoma's periphery. Hyperacute hemorrhage contains mostly oxyhemoglobin. As a result of these physical and chemical changes, a hyperacute cerebral hematoma is expected to have the following MR signal characteristics: CT scan T1-weighted image T2-weighted image Gradient echo image Diffusion (Trace) Image ADC map Above : Hyperacute cerebral hematoma imaged by CT and MR within 2 hours of ictus (click to enlarge images). The core of the hematoma is isointense to white matter on the T1-weighted image (top middle) and mildly hyperintense on the T2-weighted image (top right), representing oxy-hemoglobin. In the short interval between CT and MRI, some clot retraction has already occurred with a hyperintense peripheral halo on the T2-weighted image likely representing serum. Even at this early stage, some transition to deoxyhemoglobin formation has occurred rim hypointensity on the GRE image (bottom left). DWI (bottom center) and ADC image (bottom right) show restricted diffusion in the hematoma center due to reduced extracellular space and increased viscosity.

Specific Energy Dose (SED) is not a rate, but rather the total energy absorbed by the body during an MRI scan. It is usually measured in Joules/kg body weight.

The concept of \"The Singularity\", popularized by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil in the mid-2000s, refers to a point in the (not-so-distant) future when the intellectual capacity of computers exceeds that of humans. This idea has long existed as a negative force in the science fiction: such as the murderous computer HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey or the malignant artificial neural network Skynet in the Terminator movie franchise. In the words of Stephen Hawking: The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race  It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldnt compete, and would be superseded. Even before the full Singularity occurs, some experts have expressed their doom about radiology in particular. In 2016 the famous computer scientist Geoff Hinton stated in a public lecture: I think if you work as a radiologist, youre like the coyote thats already over the edge of the cliff, but hasnt yet looked down so doesnt realize theres no ground underneath him. People should stop training radiologists now. Its just completely obvious that within 5 years deep learning is going to do better than radiologists because its going to get a lot more experience. It might be ten years but weve got plenty of radiologists already. I said this at a hospital and it didnt go down too well. In the months after making this provocative statement, however, Hinton became aware of the many important non-interpretive functions performed by radiologists and substantially modified his view. Today, 6 years later, radiologists have not yet become obsolete but are clearly more focused on the impact AI will have on their future practice of medicine. As for me, I am happy to be mostly retired from clinical radiology; I need not worry a computer is going to take over my job as a radiologist. And certainly not as a grandfather. I am proud to have developed a considerable knowledge base in radiology during my career, and through my skills was able to help a large number of patients, including diagnosing a number of rare diseases missed by others. I enjoyed tremendously passing on what knowledge I had gained to several generations of radiology trainees and now to an even wider audience through this web site. I can't predict if or when the Singularity may occur. But whether or not that point is ultimately reached, it is important to understand how our jobs and and lives will be dramatically transformed by AI in ways we cannot fully imagine. Concerning radiology in particular, I have no doubt that within the next decade, computers will be able to read imaging studies with greater speed and accuracy than the best radiologists. But before we bemoan this fate, let us never forget the potential good this will bring to humanity. Computers using AI will discover patterns of disease we humans have long overlooked. They will be able to identify genetic subtypes of disease that can alter therapy. They will be able to precisely calculate small changes in lesion size and biological response. They will diagnose the rarest of diseases, previously the provenance of super-specialists. And they will never miss common but subtle abnormalities: a tiny lung nodule, hairline fracture, or early cancer  unlike we bleary-eyed humans might at the end of our long shifts. So, my personal advice is that you must focus your career on being more than just a \"film reader\". (You'll still be OK for a few years if that's all you want to be. Perhaps you'll survive for a decade, but the machines will ultimately beat you at this game). Think about what you do that will be hard for computers to replicate  like comforting a patient when you've made a diagnosis of cancer; advising a mother on the best interventional procedure for her child; consulting with other physicians about imaging strategies for their patients; treating and counseling a patient who developed hives after contrast administration. To me at least, the best strategy for surviving in the face of a potential Singularity is simply to focus on being human.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/is-the-singularity-near.html"}

Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling (CASL) techniques, described in the prior Q&A , are now primarily of historical and didactic interest, having fallen out of favor by the late 1990s. The main problems with CASL were its high tissue energy deposition and transmitter duty-cycle requirements accompanying the use of continuous RF-pulses. Thus came PASL, a family of ASL methods using pulsed (rather than continuous) RF-excitation. Three PASL variants are illustrated in the diagram below. Pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling (PASL) methods The first PASL method was developed by Edelman and colleagues in the mid-1990s and called EPISTAR (Echo-Planar Imaging-based Signal Targeting by Alternating Radiofrequency pulses) . The tagging sequence of EPISTAR begins with a slice-selective 90-pulse and spoiler gradient to initially saturate magnetization in the imaged slice. (The profile of this pulse is usually slightly wider than the imaged slice to minimize artifacts from RF-side lobes and ensure uniform saturation). A wide inversion slab is then applied proximally using a 180 adiabatic RF-pulse that inverts inflowing spins. The control sequence repeats the 90-spoiler saturation of static tissue in the imaged slice, followed by a mirror-image distally placed thick inversion slab to create MT effects equivalent to those of the first slab. Subtraction of the tagged from control images produces a perfusion-weighted image where MT effects have been minimized. Single-slice EPISTAR has subsequently evolved into several multi-slice variants ( STAR , PULSAR , and QUASAR ), some of which have been offered as commercial products by Philips. These are described briefly in the", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/pasl.html"}

Most modern MR systems are built in a parallel architecture, consisting of a body transmit coil and set of local receiver coils that feed into parallel channels for signal amplification and processing. When operated in parallel imaging (PI) mode, information about coil positions and sensitivities can be used to reduce the number of phase-encoding steps and speed up imaging. This is quantified by the PI acceleration factor (R) , a number typically between 2 and 6. The decision to use PI acceleration depends on the spatial and temporal requirements of a particular study, the field strength at which the study is performed, and the object of interest. The major advantages of PI can be briefly enumerated: Significant reduction in image acquisition time . This is inversely related to the acceleration factor (R). If R=2, for example, image acquisition time is cut in half. This time savings can be monetized (time=$/euros/yen), used for additional sequences, or to obtain higher spatial or temporal resolution at the original imaging time. Reduction in susceptibility artifacts . Phase-related distortions in the MR signal are lessened by the PI acquisition and reconstruction process. This is especially advantageous in echo-planar sequences. Reduced susceptibility distortions seen on these single-shot DW images using PI Notwithstanding these benefits, the limitations of PI must be considered: Reduction in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) . Even in the absence of motion, all PI techniques extract a significant penalty in terms of SNR. When R=2, image SNR is reduced by  2, or 40%. This disadvantage will be much less of a problem at higher fields (where intrinsic SNR is greater) and in certain anatomic regions (like the brain) that are relatively symmetric and homogeneous. Increased PI-specific artifacts . Because PI depends on estimation of coil sensitivities or their harmonic contributions, additional image-processing related artifacts are always present that are non-uniformly distributed. These reconstruction errors increase with the acceleration factor (R) but can be reduced by increasing the number of coil elements. No acceleration (R=1) With acceleration (R=4) showing artifacts So, when should you use PI acceleration, and when shouldn't you? There is no clear \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer, and in general the decision must be made by trial and error based on imaging time and image quality. If you can achieve your desired voxel resolution and spatial coverage in a reasonable time frame without using PI, then you are probably better not to use it. At our institution use PI rather sparingly for neuroradiology and musculoskeletal imaging, but use it extensively in chest and abdominal imaging. We also use PI more at 3T than 1.5T. As the techniques and coils continue to evolve, we expect this use to increase in all areas.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-and-when-to-use.html"}

The next step of routine prescan involves setting the center frequency . This is a relatively fine adjustment that tells the scanner at exactly what frequency the protons of interest are resonating in the magnet's isocenter. (Even after careful coil tuning, patient-to-patient variations in susceptibility may change this value by a few dozen hertz, potentially resulting in a few millimeters of error in spatial localization). Setting the center frequency also allows identification and tuning on a proton species of interest. By virtue of their chemical shifts , water and fat protons resonate at slightly different frequencies (about 220 Hz difference at 1.5T). These separate peaks can be recognized on the crude calibration scan image shown right where signal intensity of the entire imaged volume is displayed as a function of frequency. For example, the center frequency may be set on water protons, fat protons, or some average of the two. Accurate center frequency setting is particularly important when fat saturation pulses are employed. Although automated methods work pretty well, in difficult anatomy where significant quantities of fat or magnetic field inhomogeneities are present, MR technologists frequently check this crude spectrum to insure that the proper peak is being identified. By moving a cursor under the tip of the chosen peak, both coarse and fine adjustments to center frequency can be made.

Chemical structure of lactate showing J -coupling between the methyl (blue) and methine (red) protons. Lactate , the conjugate base of lactic acid, is produced during the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. It is present in small quantities in normal tissues, but accumulates significantly during states of hypoxic stress. The principal H spectral peak of lactate is derived from its methyl protons (C H 3 ) and is centered at  = 1.32 ppm. Because of J-coupling interaction with the solitary methine proton ( C H ), lactate's primary peak is split into a doublet . The methine proton (at  = 4.10 ppm), is in turn split into a quartet by the three methyl protons. This quartet is seldom identified on routine MRS studies, however, due to its small amplitude and proximity to the broad, dominant water peak at  = 4.65 ppm. Lactate doublet (arrow) at 1.32 ppm is inverted at TE = 144 ms but upright at TE = 288 ms . The physical basis of J -coupling has been described more completely in a separate Q&A . For lactate, the measured value of the coupling constant (J) is ~7 Hz. This means that the resonant frequency of the methyl protons go in and out of phase in the spectrum every (1/ J ) = (1/7Hz)  144 ms. The protons are initially in phase with one another, so that images acquired at very short TE values (e.g., TE = 30) will show an upright lactate doublet. Images acquired at TE  144 ms will show an inverted doublet, while those at TE  288 ms will again show an upright doublet. The process is analogous to the more familiar in-phase/out-of-phase phenomenon between water and fat protons commonly seen in gradient echo imaging. Although lactate is perhaps the most famous and easily visualized spectral doublet, it is not the only metabolite with J -coupling whose peak(s) may be flipped upside down. For example, the small secondary peaks of NAA and taurine are doublets that can also be inverted with appropriate choice of TE . The reason the major peaks (such as NAA, Cho, and Cr) always remain upright in H NMR spectra is because they are singlets , arising from protons without nearest neighbor hydrogens that do not experience J -coupling.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/lactate-inversion.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding \"MR Conditional\" Crutchfield carotid artery clamp (From Dr J Keshavamurthy Radiopaedia.org ) Don't worry. You probably never will. Carotid artery vascular clamps were developed in the 1950s to reduce flow to complex intracranial aneurysms and vascular malformations. Names you may have heard include Crutchfield, Poppen-Blaylock, and Selverstone. I am not aware of any such devices being implanted at my institution for the last 40 years, as they have given way to more modern neurointerventional treatments. (These permanently implanted devices should be distinguished from temporary carotid clamps used during open carotid surgery and then removed). In the off-chance you do encounter an older patient with one of these legacy devices, do not have concern. Nearly all of these clamps were made of non-ferromagnetic titanium and should be safe to scan. There should be no risk of bleeding as the carotid artery is already occluded and no risk of movement as scar formation around the device in the neck musculature should provide stability. Poppen-Blaylock clamp. You'll never see one. I should comment about the \"infamous\" Poppen-Blaylock carotid clamp, device that continues to be mentioned decades later as a potentially dangerous device and absolute contraindication to MR imaging. These clamps were made of ferromagnetic stainless steel and did indeed experience significant magnetic torque and displacement in bench testing. However, being 5-6 cm in length they were never permanently implanted and removed from the patient after short-term use. So as far as I am concerned, all Poppen-Blaylock clamp references should be deleted and relegated to the bins of MR history, as they will never be encountered now or in the future.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/carotid-clamps.html"}

How are these points the same as spatial frequency? When a frequency-encoding gradient is applied during evolution of the MR signal, successive data points in the echo (or FID) reflect progressively increasing spatial frequencies. This allows the sampled raw data from the MR signal to be plugged directly into the k -space matrix. The \"Miracle\" of k- space In other words, each data point of the MR signal is already in \"Fourier format.\" I call this surprising fact the \"Miracle\" of k -space! Why this miracle occurs is not intuitively obvious and will require some explanation. The diagram below shows a hypothetical FID obtained from an MR slice through the upper abdomen. The FID has undergone accelerated decay due to the action of a dephasing gradient G(x) that is directed along the horizontal axis. G(x) might serve as either a frequency- or phase-encoding gradient. For simplicity we assume G(x) varies linearly with position ( x ), having the form G(x) = G  x, where G is expressed in mT/meter or equivalent units. While G(x) is being applied, the total magnetic field at a given location is B(x) = B o + G(x) . The corresponding resonance frequency at location x is therefore f(x) = B(x) = B o + G(x) = f o + Gx. where  is the gyromagnetic ratio and f o is the Larmor frequency of the main magnetic field ( B o ). Under action of the gradient, the resonant frequencies increase from left-to-right across the image as long as the gradient is being applied. Once the gradient is turned off, the resonant frequencies all revert to f o . While the gradient is applied, protons in the higher parts of the field will precess more rapidly and gain phase compared to those in lower parts of the field. This phase shift persists even after the gradient has been turned off. Because phase = frequency x time, the phase gain is directly proportional to the length of time ( t ) the gradient is applied. As a function of position ( x ), the phase gain is given by  ( x,t ) = ( Gx )  t = ( Gt )  x = k x ( t )  x where k x ( t ) = Gt. This is the same \" k x \" of k -space fame, expressing phase cycles per unit distance along the x -direction. Another way to think of k ( t ) is as the gyromagnetic ratio (  ) times the area under the gradient ( G ) curve at time ( t ). Even though we have assumed a linear, rectangular gradient waveform varying along the x -axis in our simplified example above, the same definition holds for any arbitrary gradient shape and direction ( r ). Specifically, When t = t early , k x is small and the spread of phases across the image is very small. When t = t late , k x is large and many phase cycles encompass the image. The resultant MR signal at each point in time ( t ) thus reflects increasing spatial frequencies and the summed phase angles from all locations in the image. Hence each successive point along the MR signal reflects progressively higher spatial frequencies whose values can be used to \"miraculously\" fill k -space cells directly. Gradient applied to 2 objects - one uniform/solid (blue) and the other periodic (red). When phase encoding matches period of red object, a strong signal is recorded. If the above discussion was too mathematical, perhaps the example left will provide some additional insight. Here two objects, one of uniform density (blue) and the other of periodic density (red, like a fence), have been subjected to the same gradient field. We assume this gradient has induced a set of phase shifts (green) across both objects, whose spatial frequency happens to match that of the red object. Because the uniform (blue) object extends over multiple phase cycles, no signal would be observed as magnetization vectors would all cancel. In other words, for each pixel in the uniform object with phase shift , it would be easy to find another pixel with phase shift . Conversely, the red object would generate a strong signal at this phase encoding, as the spatial frequency inherent in the object would exactly match that produced by the gradient.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-signal-harr-k-space.html"}

To set up a 3D-FSE MRA scan, the following steps are typically performed: 1. Reliable EKG or peripheral pulse gating is first established. 2. A low-resolution localizer is obtained to identify anatomy and position a 3D FSE slab over area of interest. Depending on the area scanned, a spatial saturation pulse may needed to reduce the size of the 3D slab and prevent wrap-around. 3. Proper delay times for systolic and diastolic imaging must next be determined. For more proximal vessels technologists may be able to estimate these values based on experience. For more distal vessels a calibration procedure is generally advised. This involves running an additional cine scout sequence using single shot fast spin echo (SSFSE/HASTE) technique. Placing a cursor over the target vessel from these cine scout images, maximum and minimum signal intensities can be graphically displayed and optimal systolic and diastolic delay times computed. Note that these times may differ significantly between the two extremities as a result of atherosclerosis or variant anatomy. 4. Once the systolic and diastolic delay times have been determined, the final scan may be run. Typically the TR value is set to about 3-4 times the cardiac (R-R) interval. The flip angle (  ) is typically chosen in the range of 120150, but to detect smaller and more slowly flowing vessels, values closer to 90 may be used. 5. Fat suppression is not technically necessary since fat is removed by the subtraction process. However, a STIR or SPAIR pulse is sometimes used to suppress fat on the individual systolic and diastolic source images that are typically reviewed as part of the diagnostic workflow. 3D FSE MRA of aorta, iliac and lower extremity arteries performed in 5 separate acquisitions (Courtesy Siemens) 6. The 3D FSE pulse sequence is most sensitive to motion when artery of interest is oriented in the direction of the readout gradient. This is the result of endogenous spoiling (disruption) of transverse coherences by the alternating echoes in the FSE train. Accentuated systolic signal loss (\"flow void\") may be produced by applying additional flow-spoiling gradients as an option. This improves the visibility of smaller, peripheral, and more slowly flowing vessels. 7. Alternatively, sometimes too much turbulence and flow disruption occurs in larger central arteries without significant stasis in diastole to produce a measurable intraluminal signal. In this situation, flow-compensating gradients (similar to those used for gradient-moment nulling) are employed. These gradients increase the diastolic signal so that the final subtraction image (diastolic  systolic) will provide a good representation of the high-flow artery.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/3d-fse-mra-parameters.html"}

Spoiling refers to the disruption of transverse coherences that may persist from cycle to cycle in a GRE sequence. Spoiling ensures that immediately before each RF-pulse, the steady-state magnetization has no transverse components. The longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) does reach a steady-state ( M ss ) in the z -direction, but the transverse magnetization ( M xy ) is obliterated at the end of each cycle and no transverse steady-state ( M ' ss ) is established. Comparison of spoiled (left) and unspoiled GRE images. Both have identical parameters: TR = 33, TE = 4,  = 30. Believe it or not, it is actually quite difficult to achieve perfect spoiling, as pesky stimulated echoes and distant coherences have a habit of reappearing! Three methods may be used alone or in combination to spoil transverse magnetization: 1 . Long TR spoiling . When TR >>T2*, the transverse magnetization will naturally decay to zero by the end of the cycle. Thus any gradient echo sequence using TR values of several hundred milliseconds or longer will be \"naturally\" spoiled. Spoiling can be enhanced by operating the sequence in a 2D multi-slice mode. Here, off-resonant effects from RF-pulses for other slices and their associated imaging gradients will further disrupt transverse coherences. Sequences that take advantage of this method include GE's MPGR and MERGE, Siemens' MEDIC, and Philips' multi-FFE. 2 . Gradient spoiling . In this method spoiling is performed by applying the slice-select (and sometimes readout) gradients with variable amplitudes at the end of each cycle just before the next RF pulse. The strength of the spoiler gradient is varied linearly or semi-randomly from view to view. This method is not entirely adequate by itself, as the spoiling will be spatially nonuniform because gradients produce spatially varying fields. This leads to the third and best method.... 3 . RF-spoiling . Here the phase of the RF-carrier is changed according to a predefined formula from view to view. Using a completely randomized pattern of phase changes is not ideal in that unintended spin clustering may occur and the degree of spoiling may change from one interval to the next. A superior method is to increment the phase quadratically using a recursive formula. In both theory and practice, RF-spoiling is superior to gradient spoiling because it does not generate eddy currents and is spatially invariant. RF-spoiling is universally used by all vendors for their dedicated spoiled sequences. These include GE's SPGR and FSPGR, Siemens' FLASH and VIBE, and Philips' T1-FFE. Simplified pulse timing diagrams for a \"Basic\" (unspoiled) GRE sequence and and one using both gradient and RF-spoiling are shown below.

{"id": "ed3fb982-0f84-4990-9a5f-ff27fb473371", "contents": "Flow-compensation Please explain how flow compensation (gradient-moment nulling) software works. The idea of adjusting the waveforms of imaging gradients to correct for flow-related dephasing was first implemented by Picker scientist Fred Pattany working at Wake Forest in the late 1980's. The original technique was known as MAST (Motion Artifact Suppression Technique) proved immediately useful for suppressing artifacts and improving quality of MR images. Other vendors quickly followed suit, creating similar pulse sequences that became generically known as \" flow compensation \" or \" gradient-moment nulling \". Today these methods are known by various trade names: Siemens ( GMR = \"Gradient-Moment Rephasing\"), GE (\" Flow Comp \"), Philips ( FLAG = \"FLow Adjusted gradients\"), Hitachi ( GR - \"Gradient Rephasing\"), and Canon ( FC = \"Flow Compensation\"). Without gradient-moment nulling (GMN) With GMN: Note clearer delineation of vessels In gradient-moment nulling, additional gradient lobes are added prior to signal readout to compensate in advance for motion-induced dephasing at the time of the echo. As a simple example, let us analyze the velocity-compensated GRE sequence shown right. Note that the readout gradient has a more complex appearance than in the usual GRE sequence, with the addition of the two orange lobes. These additional gradient lobes give this sequence its flow-compensation properties. For stationary spins, the additional orange gradient lobes have no net effect, each adding or subtracting a constant amount of phase. Since there are two positive-going and two negatively-going lobes before the center of the echo, their net effect is zero. The net phase changes for spins moving at constant velocity are shown in the lower portion of the diagram. Using the standard GRE readout gradient, moving spins accumulate phase that is nonzero at the center of the echo (blue circle). This non-zero phase at mid-echo results in signal loss. These two extra GMN lobes play a clever little game with the phase. The first orange lobe creates a phase gain, but the second orange lobe during the next time interval, when added to the phase changes from the first blue lobe, create a strongly negative phase loss. By the middle of readout, however, the net phase of the moving spins using GMN has returned to zero (orange circle). This is a very simple illustration using a GRE sequence, but the same method may be applied to other pulse sequences and imaging axes. For example, GMN can be performed along the slice-select direction as well as along the readout direction. It can also be extended to correct for higher orders of motion, such as constant acceleration. The principal limitations of GMN techniques are: (1) they correct only for motion at constant velocity or acceleration; (2) the minimum TE is lengthened because time is needed to fit in the extra gradient lobes; (3) stresses on the imaging gradients are increased, potentially limiting field-of-view or slice thickness for a given TR ; and (4) artifacts caused by eddy currents may be induced by the rapid gradient switching required.

Many diffuse diseases of heart muscle ( cadiomyopathies ) may not produce focal changes in signal intensity, motion, or enhancement on routine cardiac MRI studies. These disorders, however, may affect global myocardial NMR properties, such as T1, T2, or T2* relaxation times. Specialized pulse sequences optimized for cardiac imaging are able to estimate these relaxation values and even create color anatomic overlay maps for each parameter. On this web page I will discuss T1-mapping; later Q&A's will describe T2-mapping (for edema detection) and T2* measurements (for iron deposition). Colored T1 map from which T1 values can be measured. The T1 value of normal myocardium at 1.5T is approximately 950-1000 ms at 1.5T and 1100-1250 at 3.0T. Myocardial T1 is prolonged in most forms of pathology, including edema (from acute infarction or myocarditis) and as the end result of many chronic cardiac and systemic disorders (such as hypertrophic, toxic, and dilated cardiomyopathies; remote ischemia/infarction; diabetes; valvular disease; amyloidosis; and sarcoidosis). T1 shortening due to pathology is rare, but can be seen in disorders like Fabry disease, fatty arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), or hemochromatosis where glycoproteins, lipids, or iron respectively are deposited in the myocardium. Of course, gadolinium contrast accumulation shortens T1 values in both healthy and diseased myocardium. T1-myocardial mapping may be performed either with or without contrast. When done without contrast it is commonly referred to as \"native\" T1-mapping . Administration of gadolinium contrast shortens the T1 of both normal and diseased myocardium. Postcontrast T1-mapping may be useful to better differentiate and quantify enhancement in various areas of the heart. The traditional \"gold standard\" method for determining tissue T1 is to perform a series of independent single-point inversion recovery signal measurements at different TI's . Very long TR's are required to allow the restoration of full longitudinal magnetization M o between measurements. These data points lie along an exponential growth curve ( shown in green in the diagram right ). By mathematical fitting T1 can be easily calculated. The single-point IR method may require 20+ minutes of data sampling, and hence is too time-consuming for practical clinical application. A comparison of longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) using the classic (but time-consuming) single-point IR method with a rapid GRE method (Look-Locker). The latter method produces a lower equilibrium magnetization and consistently shorter T1 estimates, often denoted T1*. Even before the development of MR imaging , laboratory NMR chemists searched for faster ways to determine the T1's of their samples. In 1970 Look and Locker reasoned that instead of making a single measurement at a fixed TI after inversion, many more data points could be acquired by sampling a periodic train of rapidly applied constant flip-angle pulses. If the RF-pulse train were sufficiently long, the longitudinal magnetization would be driven to a new steady state (which, of course, would be lower than the undisturbed equilibrium state ( M o ) of the classic IR method). An estimate for T1 could nevertheless be derived by observing the rate of change of signal amplitudes sampled during this periodic pulse train. Notwithstanding the theoretical corrections, T1 values computed by the Look-Locker method depend on a number of factors, including type of pulse sequence (GRE vs b-SSFP), flip angle, TR , tissue T2, field strength, magnetization transfer effects, RF-inhomogeneity, and heart rate. Because of this experimental dependency, we are not measuring \"true\" T1, but a consistently shorter \"apparent\" T1 . Analogous to the term used in T2 relaxation, apparent T1 is often called T1* (\"T1-star\") . At present the most widely used T1 measurement sequence is Modified Look-Locker Imaging (MOLLI). The basic strategy is to use only 2-3 inversion pulses followed by several single-shot b-SSFP readouts at various fixed inversion times. Short rest periods are interspersed to allow recovery of longitudinal magnetization between cycles. In conjunction with parallel imaging and conjugate symmetry methods, MOLLI allows accurate T1-values of myocardium to be obtained in only one breath-hold per slice (~20 sec). Modified Look-Locker Imaging (MOLLI) with 5(3)3 pattern. In one common implementation illustrated above, 5(3)3 MOLLI, measurements are obtained at different TI's over 5+3=8 heart beats with a 3 beat recovery period in between. The inversion pulses are placed so that readout periods (a, b, c, ...) all occur at the same place in the cardiac cycle, allowing pixel-wise T1 calculations to be performed. The recovery period may be reduced on post-contrast imaging due to the lower T1 values of gadolinium-containing myocardium. For patients who cannot suspend respiration for 20+ seconds, shortened MOLLI (shMOLLI) using a 5-1-1 scheme is available. SASHA Technique of T1-mapping. Multiple 90-pulses tip the magnetization into the transverse plane with each heart beat. Signal readouts are performed at the same position in the cardiac cycle, but at different TI's. A baseline data point (not shown) is acquired without magnetization preparation. By curve fitting T1 can be computed for each point. Saturation recovery (SR) methods for T1 mapping are becoming increasingly popular, the best known of which is called SASHA (SAturation-recovery single-SHot Acquisition) . SR recovery methods use 90- instead of 180-pulses, which have the advantage of removing magnetization memory from prior cycles and allowing a direct estimate of true T1 to be made. Disadvantages include lower SNR and more artifacts.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/t1-mapping.html"}

Some additional processes also exist (such as static local fields and spin \"flip-flops\") that cause T2 relaxation without affecting T1. T2 relaxation always proceeds at a faster rate than T1 relaxation; thus the the T1 relaxation time is always longer than or equal to T2. Approximate values of T1 and T2 at 1.5T To the left is a table listing T1 and T2 values for hydrogen nuclei in various biological tissues. In lectures I generally show this chart to my students and ask them to identify the trends they see. I expect them to make at least three observations: 1) that for most organs T1 values are typically about 5-10x longer than T2 values; 2) that pure liquids (water/CSF) have very long T1 and T2 values; and 3) that dense solids (ice, tendons, and proteins) have very short T2 values. In future Q&A's you will gain a more quantitative understanding of why various tissues and substances have these particular T1 and T2 values. For now suffice it to say that the most important determinant is the size and motion of the molecule on which the hydrogen nucleus resides. This can be appreciated in the graph right showing T1 and T2 relaxation times plotted as a function of molecular \"tumbling\" rate. Small, rapidly rotating molecules (like free water) have long T1 and T2 times. As molecular motion slows (as in proteins and dense solids), T2 shortens and T1 again increases.

Ablavar (gadofosveset) , the most recently approved gadolinium-based MR contrast in the US, was withdrawn as a product in 2017 by its manufacturer due to poor sales. Ablavar had been designed specifically for vascular imaging. As seen in the structural diagram right, Ablavar is a derivative of Gd-DTPA with a diphenyl-cyclohexyl-phosphate group attached to the ligand. This moiety resulted in appreciable (80-90%) reversible bonding to plasma proteins (principally albumin) when injected into the blood, allowing it to be confined intravascularly for several hours. As only a relatively small amount reached the extracellular spaces, Ablavar could not be used interchangeably with other nonspecific gadolinium-contrast agents (to detect blood-brain barrier breakdown, for example). Following IV injection, two sets of images were typically acquired -- a first-pass arterial phase and later steady-state phase showing distribution through the entire vascular system (arteries and veins).

Modern cine cardiac imaging typically employs a steady-state free precession (SSFP) method consisting of a train of rapidly acquired RF-pulses with echoes formed by balanced imaging gradients. This technique goes under a variety of trade names, including TrueFISP (Siemens), balanced-FFE (Philips), FIESTA (GE), BSARG (Hitachi), and True SSFP (Canon). The use of balanced (symmetric) imaging gradients allows simultaneous refocusing of spin echoes, gradient echoes, and stimulated echoes exactly at the midpoint between RF-pulses. The echo time ( TE ) is made as short as possible, which on modern systems can be in the 1-2 ms range. RF-flip angle (  ) is made large (80-90) to accentuate T2/T1 contrast and produce bright blood images. Balanced-SSFP sequence used for cardiac cine In conventional MR imaging, the repetition time (TR) of an SSFP sequence should be defined as the interval between successive RF-pulses. In the diagram above I have labelled this as the \"True\" TR. In cardiac MRI, however, a different convention is used. The TR value used in cardiac MRI is the time allotted to recording data from an each cardiac frame (segment). If, for example, 7 lines of k -space are acquired for each cardiac frame, the \"reported\" TR would be 7x the \"true\" TR . Although called both are called \"repetition times\", I prefer to think of the \"reported\" TR used in cardiac MRI as an abbreviation for \" temporal resolution .\" The term repetition time ( TR ) has a different use in cardiac MRI, better thought of a the time allotted to acquiring data for each frame (segment) rather than \"true\" TR. Trade-off between temporal resolution and acquisition time. Imaging more cardiac phases mean fewer lines of k -space can be sampled per frame. A trade-off exists between temporal and spatial resolution . The number of cardiac frames (segments) acquired during a single R-R interval and the number of lines per segment are interrelated. As can be seen in the diagram left, if more cardiac phases are desired, fewer lines of k -space can be sampled within each frame, resulting in increased acquisition time. View-sharing creates additional frames by using data from adjacent frames in the cardiac cycle. More cardiac phases can be generated by reusing data from adjacent frames through a process known as view-sharing . As seen in the diagram left, interpolated frames labelled 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc. can be created by combining data from neighboring segments.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/cine-parameters.html"}

MR angiography is always evolving, with new methods and modifications of older methods being constantly proposed. Several new techniques have even made their ways into limited clinical practice, being offered by a small number of vendors as commercial products or work-in-progress (WIP) sequences for testing. Some of these newest and most promising MRA techniques are briefly described below. Flow-Sensitive Dephasing (FSD) FSD is a non-contrast subtraction technique similar to the 3D-gated FSE MRA method described in a prior Q&A . The FSD sequence simultaneously acquires a diastolic image (where both arteries and veins are bright) and a systolic image (where veins remain bright but arteries are dark). By subtracting these two images a pure arterial image remains. The FSD method is a T2-preparatory module that can be appended to either a 3D-balanced SSFP or 3D-FSE sequence. The FSD module consists of a cluster of three RF-pulses in a driven-equilibrium (DE) arrangement (90/180/90). The 90 flip-back pulse in the DE cluster helps restore longitudinal magnetization of blood, accentuating its signal. Sandwiched on either side of the 180-pulse are mirror-image bipolar gradients. Unlike the bipolar gradients used in phase-contrast MRA, the gradients in FSD are turned on only during collection of the systolic image and are used to dephase arterial signal. A spoiler gradient is applied at the end of the module to prevent dephased spins from refocusing in later modules. The choice of optimal gradient strength is tricky to preserve high arterial signal and prevent venous contamination. To detect flow in multiple directions, additional FSD modules performed in orthogonal orientations may be needed. Promising applications of FSD MRA include imaging the small vessels of the hands and feet. FSD module is based on a cluster of RF-pulses in a driven equilibrium configuration. Bipolar gradients (B) induce accelerated arterial dephasing in systole. A spoiler gradient (S) is destroys residual transverse magnetization to prevent unwanted later echoes. Hand MRA using gated FSD-prepared balanced SSFP Quiescent-Interval Single-Shot (QISS) MRA QISS is a cardiac-gated, non-contrast inflow technique bearing some similarities to 2D time-of-flight (TOF) and inflow-enhanced SSFP MRA. It is especially designed for peripheral MRA. The sequence begins with a pair of closely-spaced 90-RF pulses, one to saturate signal in the slice to be imaged and the other more distally located to suppress venous inflow. Next comes a quiescent interval (QI) of about 230 ms, during which fresh (unsaturated/fully magnetized) blood enters the imaging slice. A brief fat-suppression pulse is then applied to destroy any fat signal that has recovered during the QI. Finally, the desired arterial signal is acquired from the slice using a 2D single-shot, balanced SSFP sequence. The long quiescent interval provides much more complete refreshment of blood than TOF methods with their much shorter TR's ( 30 msec). In theory this allows better detection of slowly flowing blood. Like 2D TOF, QISS performs best when arteries are long and perpendicular to the plane of imaging. Similar to stepped-table bolus-chase MRA, the peripheral arteries can be examined in 8-10 groups of 40-50 slices as the patient is moved through the magnet isocenter. Because SSFP readout is used, automatic reshimming may be needed at each station in the runoff. QISS MRA of the lower extremities. Note 'venetian blind' artifacts at junctions of adjacent slabs. Gated Time-of-Flight (TOF) Inflow MRA Simple cardiac gating can improve the appearance of a 2D TOF MR angiogram at the expense of increased imaging time. Even further improvements can be achieved if the k -space ordering is adjusted so that the central lines of k -space occur during peak velocity (systolic phase). The primary advantage is the reduction of pulsatile flow artifacts causing physical movement of the artery and spatial blurring. Philips offers a dual-gated method which acquires segmented data both in systole and diastole. This may offer some advantage in characterizing the degree of stenotic lesions.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/other-mra-methods.html"}

Each slab is typically less than 5 cm in thickness, so the number of contained slices is small (e.g., 16-32). Because of this restricted slab thickness, loss of signal due to saturation effects is relatively limited, even at the exit slices. MOTSA thus offers a method to cover a relatively large anatomic area using 3D TOF with preserved intravascular signal intensity.

In brief, CSI offers both a larger total coverage area and higher spatial resolution than single-voxel methods. The potential for a wide coverage area allows evaluation of large, heterogenous lesions, while smaller size of individual voxels is advantageous for small or irregularly shaped lesions. The major disadvantages of multi-voxel CSI include: 1) Longer set-up and imaging time; 2) difficulties obtaining homogenous shim over the entire region; 3) lower signal-to-noise and spectral quality for individual voxels; 4) spectral contamination from adjacent voxels. Of all these limitations, imaging time constraints are perhaps the most critical. To complete an imaging cycle for spatial localization, an entire set of phase-encoding gradients must all be stepped through in a nested fashion.

Gauss (G) is the unit of measurement for B in the older CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system, whereas tesla (T) is the preferred Systme Internationale (SI) term. For conversion, 1 T equals 10,000 G . Alternatively, 1 G = 0.1 mT. Because the tesla is a relatively large unit, it is most suitably used to define the strength of the main magnetic field in the center of an MR scanner. Gauss are sometimes used when describing much smaller fields, such as those associated with gradients, radiofrequency coils, or fringe fields at some distance from the MR scanner.

A typical MR scan may contain over 4 million voxels, each generating its own tiny MR signal. With such a huge array to analyze, how does the scanner possibly sort out where each signal is coming from? The answer to this question is not simple, and several dozen Q&A's in the next few tabs will be devoted to exploring various imaging strategies. In brief, the following methods are employed, often in combination: Differences in frequency . Magnetic field gradients are applied that alter the main magnetic field in a spatially specific pattern, changing the local resonance frequency by a few hundred to a few thousand Hz. Frequency localization methods are commonly used for: a) slice selection in 2D imaging; and b) spatial position encoding within a given slice. Differences in phase . Applying an imaging gradient results in a gain or loss in phase that persists even after the gradient has been turned off. Phase localization methods are used for: a) slice selection in 3D imaging; and b) spatial position encoding within a given slice. Differences in signal timing . Pulse sequences often have considerable amounts of \"wait time\" after signal collection and before the next RF-excitation. This provides a window for stimulating other slices or parts of the imaged volume and collecting signals at different time offsets. 2D-multislice imaging uses this method. Distance from receiver coils . Proximity to surface receiver coils provides information about a voxel's position. Coils near a voxel record stronger signals than coils farther away. This difference in signal intensity among receiver coils can be used as an aid to signal localization. This is the principle of parallel imaging , the subject of multiple later Q&A's .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-to-locate-signals.html"}

Driven equilibrium (DE) , also known as fast recovery , is technique in which a  90 \"flip-back\" pulse is used to help restore longitudinal magnetization at the end of an MR sequence. In rapid imaging, substances with long T1 and T2 values (like CSF, urine, or bile) may still not have fully recovered their longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) by the end of each TR interval. After a number of cycles, saturation occurs and the normal high T2 signals of such fluids are diminished. Driven equilibrium techniques are particularly useful at restoring these signals and are widely employed in spinal imaging, MR urography, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Driven equilibrium technique results in high signal from bile on this FSE MRCP image using a short TR (1200 ms) As shown in the diagram left, a fluid with long T1 and T2 may still have appreciable transverse magnetization at the end of a cycle. By applying a 90-pulse, this transverse magnetization is flipped back into the longitudinal plane aiding T1 recovery and augmenting the MR signal. Driven equilibrium pulses may be used in conjunction with virtually any imaging or spectroscopy sequence, but are most commonly employed with Fast/Turbo spin echo imaging. All major MR vendors offer these sequences under different trade names: Siemens' RESTORE , GE's Fast recovery fast spin echo ( FRFSE ), Philips' DRIVE , Hitachi's Driven equilibrium FSE , and Cannon's T2 Plus FSE . Occasionally the generic acronym DEFT (Driven Equilibrium Fourier Transform) is used. A typical 2D fast spin echo implementation is shown below. A 90 DE pulse applied at the end of an FSE sequence A cluster of three nonselective pulses in DE pattern (+90/180/90) may be used as a preparatory module for spectroscopy, echo-planar imaging, and GRE sequences like MP-RAGE. Because T2-decay occurs during the time between these pulses, the module imparts T2 sensitivity and is thus often called a T2-prep pulse .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/driven-equilibrium.html"}

In 2DFT imaging, each slice is individually excited and its MR signal separately recorded and stored. Multi-slice acquisition is possible because of the \"wait times\" or \"dead times\" within the structure of most MR imaging sequences. The wait time between echo collection and the next 90-pulse can be put to good use by stimulating and recording signals from other slices during this period. The interfering frequencies between slices ( 1 and  2 ) occur at different times and hence do not interfere. Staggered slices applied during long wait times helps prevent slice-slice interactions and frequency overlap.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mixing-of-slices.html"}
{"id": "d162865b-b230-46fc-a4eb-b407263bd80c", "contents": "Magnetic Field of an MRI So then, exactly where is the most dangerous place for force or torque near an MRI scanner? As discussed in the prior Q&A , the maximum translational torque on a metallic object depends square of the local magnetic field ( B ), while the maximum translational force depends on the local magnetic field B times the spatial gradient (SG), dB/dz , an entity known as the spatial-gradient product (SGP) , or ( B )( dB/dz ). When one purchases an MR system, the vendor provides detailed field maps to help identify each of these fields in and around the scanner. These exact values are important because MR Conditional implants frequently have limits on the maximal SG or SGP through which they are allowed to pass. Below are field plots applicable to our Siemens Prisma 3.0T scanner. The sites marked with  in the diagrams represent the highest value for each parameter. As can be seen from these diagrams, the spatial gradient ( dB/dz ) and SGP are highest about a quarter to a half meter behind the face of the scanner along its inner bore. So a metal object at this location would experience the highest translational force. In the center of the scanner bore, the both dB/dz and the SGP are close to zero, so no translational force would be experienced once the object is fully inside the scanner. Torque is maximal where the B field is highest, which is generally close to the maximal sites for SG and SPG at the scanner bore entry. An interesting feature from these graphs (not widely recognized) is that the static magnetic field typically exceeds the rated value (e.g. 1.5T or 3.0T) by as much as 30% near the the bore entry along the inner wall. Since torque is proportional to the square of the magnetic field ( B ), this is the most dangerous place for torque (although in reality anywhere inside the bore of the scanner has very high B and is nearly as dangerous). My colleague Manny Kanal has developed a software application, MagnetVision (Advanced Magnetic Analytics, LLC), that provides a highly visual color representation of these fields that I find tremendously instructive. Two examples for the main field ( B ) and spatial gradient field ( dB/dz ) are shown below. Spatial distribution of main magnetic field (B o ) in a GE 450W 1.5T scanner. Note that while the vast majority of the bore is homogenous with magnitude 1.5T, near the ends of the bore the field increases to as high as 1.86T at site marked with a  . (Image courtesy of Dr. E.

Although nearly all gadolinium is cleared from the circulation by renal excretion over the first several hours in patients with normal renal function, some free gadolinium always makes its way into tissues. The displacement of gadolinium from its chelation site occurs at least in part via the so-called transmetallation reaction , where it is bumped out by another cation (such as Zn +2 or Ca +2 ). Recent papers have demonstrated that gadolinium accumulation with concomitant T1 shortening can be seen in the brains of patients who have received multiple doses of gadolinium contrast. The effect is most noticeable in the globus pallidi, thalami, pons, and dentate nuclei. The magnitude of the effect is proportional to the cumulative lifetime dose administered and occurs without renal or hepatic dysfunction. Research suggests the phenomenon is more common in linear agents with weaker chemical binding to free gadolinium than to macrocyclic agents with stronger binding. Visible changes on T1-weighted images may be present after as few as 4 exposures. An example is provided below. The patient shown right underwent 21 contrast-enhanced MR scans between 2002 and 2012 for a fourth ventricular tumor. Progressive high signal was noted on T1-weighted images in the dentate nuclei and globus pallidi over time, presumably due to gadolinium accumulation. 1st MRI scan 2002 22nd MRI scan 2012. Note high T1 signal in basal ganglia. Although deposition of gadolinium in the brain has garnered the most attention, even higher amounts have been shown to accumulate in liver, spleen, kidney and bone. However, subtle signal changes on T1-weighted MR images have not been reported in these organs. As yet no documented short or long-term adverse affects are recognized from deposition of these small amounts of Gd in tissues. Indeed, trace amounts of many other heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead, aluminum) also silently exist in the human body acquired from diet or the environment. I am not saying that gadolinium is good for you, but just because we can see it on MRI doesn't mean it is harmful. The final answer is not in concerning which of the commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents provides the least risk for tissue deposition. In late 2017 the European Medicines Agency issued a recommendation to suspend or limit use of a three linear agents throughout the EU: Omniscan, Magnevist, and MultiHance. The US FDA has not recommended limiting these agents, but has issued an edict that patients be informed about these issues and given \"Medication Guide\" describing the potential risks of receiving each type of contrast material. An example of such a recently approved Medication Guide for MultiHance  can be downloaded here.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gd-accumulation.html"}

A well recognized benefit of 7T imaging is the concomitant increase in BOLD signal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Improved SNR translates into better spatial resolution, allowing voxels  1 mm to be obtained in reasonable imaging times. High-resolution single-shot spin-echo fMRI at 7T with 0.5 mm in-plane resolution using visual activation paradigm. (From Olman et al 2011 open access) Additionally, BOLD signal at 7T more closely reflects the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in capillaries rather than in larger veins (as it does at 1.5T). This phenomenon results from a field-dependent shortening of blood T2 and T2* relative to brain described in a prior Q&A and in the references below. fMRI at 7T thus offers the potential of improved spatial specificity since cortical neuronal activity is more closely linked to blood flow changes in the microvasculature than in larger vessels. This effect can be further accentuated by using spin-echo (SE) instead of gradient echo (GRE) acquisition. Notwithstanding these advantages, some limitations at 7T are well recognized: 1) increased susceptibility artifacts near the frontal sinuses and skull base (producing spatial distortion and signal drop out); 2) increased dielectric artifacts (manifest by signal inhomogeneity); 3) increased specific absorption rate (SAR, restricting number of slices); and 4) more difficult RF-coil design and shimming (causing inhomogeneous excitation and signal variations).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fmri-at-7t.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is indicated for the management of chronic intractable pain of the back, trunk, or extremities. The typical system consists of a implanted pulse generator (IPG) located subcutaneously in the flank or lower abdomen connected by insulated lead(s) to a cylindrical or paddle-shaped electrode array placed in the posterior epidural space of the mid-to-lower thoracic spine. Permanent implantation usually follows a trial period wherein smaller cylindrical epidural test electrodes are placed in the epidural space percutaneously, with wires protruding out through the skin where they are attached to an external pulse generator. If the trial is successful at reducing pain, then a full system with a permanent pulse generator is implanted. If a paddle array is chosen, a laminectomy is required for placement. Typical configuration of an \"MR Conditional\" SCS with paddle electrode array During the 2000s about a dozen companies sold and manufactured SCS systems worldwide, including the \"big three\" ( Boston Scientific , Abbott/St. Jude , Medtronic ). Most of the early models of these devices were considered MR Unsafe primarily due to the theoretical risk of spinal cord injury from heating of the the electrode tip by RF-induced currents (the so-called antenna effect ). Additional concerns included damage to the IPG or its battery, opening of the magnetic reed switch, or resetting of IPG programming. Although more recent SCS systems are designed to be MR Conditional , a substantial number of MR Unsafe legacy devices may still be encountered in clinical practice. A partial list includes: the Boston Scientific Precision and Precision Novi; the Medtronic X-trel, I-trel , and early Matrix systems; the Abbott/St. Jude Eon, Genesis, Axium, and Renew. Notwithstanding legal and risk management issues, it may be possible (similar to the experience with legacy pacemakers) to perform low SAR MR imaging in selected patients if clinically necessary. A new generation of MR Conditional SCSs (such as the Evoke ( Saluda Medical )) have resulted from several technical advances: electromagnetic interference circuit protection filtering (filtered feed-through\"); reduction in ferrous material in the IPG; replacement of magnetic reed switches by Hall effect sensors; and lead design changes with internal spiral conductors. The precise conditions that must be followed for safe MR Scanning of SCS systems vary somewhat among the models and manufacturers. What are the Conditions? Device identification . The exact model/serial numbers from the various components of the SCS system, including the IPG, leads, and extensions (if present) must be established with certainty. This can be done by reviewing operative notes from the medical record or the patient's information card. Determine location of components . Verify (by x-ray if necessary) that the IPG has been implanted subcutaneously in the pelvis/flank. Insure that the wires are connected to the IPG without breaks and there are no abandoned leads or electrodes. Pre-MRI evaluation/interrogation of the DBS system . The IPG battery should be fully charged and lead impedances should measure within expected values. The IPG should be turned off or placed in \"MRI Mode\" if available. MRI Equipment and Protocols . These conditions will vary significantly between manufacturers and SCS models. All current MR-conditional SCS devices are restricted to H imaging in horizontal bore cylindrical magnets operating at 1.5 or 3.0T. Only the supine or prone patient positions are allowed. Limits for maximum spatial gradient, gradient slew rate, total imaging time, and RF power dissipation measured by average SAR or maximum B 1+RMS must be followed explicitly. For several models there are restrictions on the use of transmit body coils and power deposition limits dependent on the location of magnet isocenter. Before, During, and After MRI . The patient must be in a cognitive state able to provide immediate feedback concerning any problems during the examination. Visual and auditory monitoring should be continuously performed during the scan. After the exam, MRI-mode should be turned off and settings returned to pre-MRI values.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/spinal-cord-stimulators.html"}

Diffusion tensor Fluids, gels, and homogenous materials can be characterized by a single diffusion coefficient, D , representing the flux of water or small particles via Brownian motion across a surface during a period of time. As described in a previous Q&A , biological tissues are anisotropic with multiple, spatially dependent diffusion coefficients. Diffusion in anisotropic media is better described by the diffusion tensor , a 3x3 matrix containing elements ( D xx , D xy , D xz , etc) representing diffusion rates along different directions. In modern diffusion MR imaging, individual elements of the diffusion tensor are estimated by measuring phase dispersion and signal loss as diffusion-sensitizing gradients are applied in various directions. These methods, however, detect signal loss from several processes in addition to diffusion that can not be easily distinguished  cytoplasmic streaming, blood and lymphatic flow in the microcirculation, bulk tissue motion from cardiac pulsations or respiration, and phase dispersion due to susceptibility effects. Signal losses and diffusion tensor estimates also vary according to the details of the pulse sequence and timing parameters employed. Chemists in the early 1930's recognized that the measured diffusion rates of dyes and other small molecules were highly dependent both on the nature of the media studied and on experimental conditions. Recognizing these limitations, they began to use the term apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to refer to estimated diffusion rates obtained from their studies. In the modern MR literature, the term \"ADC\" is used in at least two different contexts. In the most general sense \"ADC\" is synonymous with \"measured/observed\" diffusion rates or tensor components, reflecting the methodological uncertainties described above. In other contexts, \"ADC\" is used to refer to the mean diffusion in a voxel, sometimes taken as the sum or average value of the tensor's diagonal elements. The commonly viewed ADC map reflects this latter definition. ADC map", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/apparent-diffusion.html"}

Take me to the first Q&A The individual topics covered in this section are: Spin Precession Resonance Relaxation: Physics Relaxation: Clinical In this section we will answer questions concerning the origin and nature of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) phenomenon. Although this material seems difficult, please don't be discouraged by it. Many students get so bogged down trying to visualize what is happening to individual protons at the subatomic level that they often lose sight of the bigger picture. Moreover, this confusion may be so frustrating that the student abandons all attempts to understand other aspects of MR physics. Don't let this happen to you! Part of the problem is that many textbooks juxtapose and mix two different physical explanations for NMR: (1) the classical model , with tiny bar magnets spinning like tops, subject to the laws of classical physics and electromagnetism, and (2) the quantum mechanical model , with spin states, discrete energy levels, and the like, which are subject to a different set of nonintuitive rules that subatomic particles must obey. A few subtle aspects of the NMR phenomenon can be explained adequately only by quantum mechanics, and we must either accept these by blind faith or learn enough about them so they are at least \"comfortably familiar\" to us. For most purposes, however, a detailed background in quantum mechanics is unnecessary for a good functional understanding of MR imaging. You may find it reassuring that only a few scientists doing MR imaging research in academics or industry use (or even remember much about) quantum mechanics in their daily work. Fortunately, the more easily understood classical model provides a solid foundation for describing how the NMR signal is generated and manipulated for imaging purposes. Moreover, in MR imaging we measure not the signal from individual nuclei, but only the averaged signal from billions and billions of nuclei contained within each small volume of tissue. When the averaged behavior of large numbers of nuclei are considered, predictions of the quantum and classical models converge, so our dependence on the classical description of NMR has a theoretical justification.  2024 AD Elster, ELSTER LLC All rights reserved.

Central point artifact Central Point Artifact The central point artifact appears as either a bright or a dark dot precisely at the center of the image. It results from a constant direct current (DC)-offset in the receiver electronics that when Fourier transformed becomes a small spike in the center of the image. In the early days of MR, this artifact was a common nuisance, even mimicking MS plaques. Today, however, it is rarely encountered because of the widespread use of RF-phase alternation and fully digital quadrature signal detection. If you have a 10-15 year old scanner with a partially analog receive chain, however, you may still occasionally encounter it. Data Clipping Improper calibration of the receiver amplifier gain can result in data clipping and an eerie, phantom-like image with a gray background. This artifact occurs whenever the gain setting is too high and the RF-signal exceeds the upper and lower cut-off levels of the RF amplifier (V max ). Careful recalibration and rescanning are the only means of overcoming this artifact. Data clipping artifact Data Error Artifacts From time-to-time a random \"glitch\" occurs in the data processing chain resulting in an image containing multiple lines that may be arrayed in a corduroy or herringbone pattern. A common cause is spike noise in the raw data, whose Fourier transform is a series of stripes.

The corresponding gradient coils must therefore be flat rather than cylindrical. This is no particular challenge for for z -axis gradients in a paired Maxwell arrangement.

The planar Maxwell loops simply lie flat against the upper and lower poles of the magnet and create their gradient in the vertical direction. The design of x - and y -gradients is somewhat more challenging in that the 3D Golay curved saddle-coil configuration used in cylindrical scanners is not possible. A variety of flat gradient designs exist, with most sharing principles embodied in the biplanar configuration shown in the figure to the right. The inner arcs of the coils are primarily responsible for producing the desired gradient. By rotating these coils in plane by 90 either x - or y -gradient fields can be produced. In practice transverse gradients typically have a more sophisticated design in a fingerprint distributed winding arrangement.

Chemical exchange represents the transfer of a nucleus from one molecular environment to another. Two examples with slightly different features are illustrated below. In the first case, H on a water molecule exchanges with H on an amide group in the middle of a macromolecule. Here the chemical shift and J-coupling of both H's change as they enter their new molecular environments. Based on bond enthalpies and geometry, the forward and backward rates of this chemical reaction would be relatively slow and unequal, with the equilibrium population states asymmetrically favoring H remaining on the water molecule. The second example illustrates hydrogen bonding and chemical exchange in water. Here H nuclei are \"traded\" among various molecules that are chemically indistinguishable but which may have different rotational and translational energies. The expected exchange rates would be quite fast with no preference for one water molecule over another. Because the reactants and products are identical, there would be no change in chemical shift or J-coupling. Chemical exchange between a water proton and a proton on an amide group in a macromolecule. Hydrogen bonding in water. H nuclei (such as those colored red and orange above) form bridges (dotted lines) with nearby oxygen atoms and transfer molecules. Although chemical exchange is generally thought of as involving the physical transfer of nuclei between two molecules, several equivalent processes without frank nuclear transfer exist. For example, the molecule where the proton resides may simply change its conformation (such as going from a cis - to a trans - state). A second example commonly seen in biological tissues is where an intact molecule moves or is transported between different compartments (such as from inside to outside of a cell). A final example is where an intact molecule goes from a free to a bound state (such as when free water molecules become restricted in their motion along a protein hydration layer.) The effects of chemical exchange on the Bloch equations were first modeled by McConnell and later extended by Forsn and Hoffman in the 1950s and 1960s. The simplest case is a reversible exchange of an H proton between two molecules (A  B) separated by a chemical shift frequency (f) and governed by a single reaction rate (k) . Reaction rates can vary from nanoseconds to many seconds, depending on the system studied. If the exchange rate is slow on the chemical shift time scale ( k << f ), two sets of signals are observed. For fast exchange rates ( k >> f ) only one signal is observed at an average frequency corresponding to the relative populations of the two chemical species. At intermediate exchange rates ( k  f ) very large spectral line widths (corresponding to very short T2 values) occur. Spectra for spins in two different molecules (A and B) as a function of reaction rate (k) and chemical shift (f). More complicated models including multiple molecular environments with different and asymmetric exchange rates have been developed. The results are not intuitively obvious, but can be calculated numerically under various assumptions. As a rule, most of the chemical exchange mechanisms result in a field-dependent shortening of both T1 and T2, with typically a much greater effect on T2. Chemical exchanges occurring over time frames longer than T1 do not generally affect spectral lines widths or the MR signal.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/chemical-exchange.html"}

The same active and passive magnetic shielding methods used to reduce fringe fields also protects the main magnetic field from certain outside influences, such as the presence of stationary ferromagnetic material or slowly moving stray fields outside the magnet room. Magnetic shielding of this type does not guard against high frequency electromagnetic fields outside the scanner, however. This requires a different type of protection, called radiofrequency (RF) shielding . RF shielding methods will be described in several follow-up questions. For most sites conventional magnetic shielding provides adequate protection against external field disturbances. Some MRI sites are challenged by their location near moving metal objects such as cars, buses, subways and elevators. This problem is being addressed in at least two ways. Many newer magnets manufactured by Siemens employ an \"External Interference Shield (EIS).\" This active shielding modification uses a third set of electrically shorted superconductive coils in which current flows when the magnet senses a distortion in its fringe field. The presence of moving metal outside the MR suite but interacting with the main magnetic field needs to be considered in site planning. Cars, buses, subways, and elevators may all affect the main field. An entirely different approach has been developed by ETS-Lindgren called the \"Magnetic Active Compensation System (MACS)\". This is a device external to the magnet, employing a 3-axis sensing magnetometer, a set of Helmholtz coils near the magnet and electronic feedback loop. The MACS sensors monitor the external magnetic field environment, and when an external field disturbance is detected (by a passing vehicle, for example), it drives current through the coils to create and equal, but opposing, magnetic field. This system dynamically cancels out the effect of transient environmental fluctuations, helping maintain homogeneity within the bore of the scanner.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/magnetic-shielding.html"}

The popular Tofts Model contains four parameters relating to pharmacokinetics of gadolinium in tissue. By mathematical analysis it is possible to measure these parameters and even create anatomic maps of them. But what do these parameters mean in practical terms and how do they correlate with what we observe visually on the dynamic contrast enhanced images? Gd-enhanced T1-image of malignant glioma K trans map The first and most important DCE parameter is K trans , the volume transfer constant for gadolinium between blood plasma and the tissue extravascular extracellular space (EES) . Like a chemical reaction rate, its units are given in values of (1/time), such as min 1 . In brief, K trans reflects the sum of all processes (predominantly blood flow and capillary leakage) that determine the rate of gadolinium influx from plasma into the EES. The second independent kinetic parameter appearing in the Tofts model is the fractional volume of the EES, denoted v e . It is formally defined as the volume of the EES per unit volume of tissue, and thus is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1. The parameter v e reflects the amount of \"room\" available within the tissue interstitium for accumulating gadolinium. The third parameter appearing in the Tofts model is k ep , the time constant for gadolinium reflux from the EES back into the vascular system. Recall that k ep is not a fully independent parameter, being defined as a ratio of the first two (i.e., k ep = K trans / v e ). So an increase in k ep may reflect an increase in K trans , a decrease in v e , or both. A fourth parameter appearing in the expanded Tofts model is v p , the fractional plasma volume. In many lesions this variable is small and inconsequential. In highly vascular tumors, however, the intravascular contribution to total signal may be 10% or more and cannot be ignored. A direct connection exists between K trans , v e , k ep , and v p and the appearance of the signal (concentration) vs time curves of various tissues. Specifically, K trans correlates with the initial slope (\"wash-in\" rate) of the time-intensity curve v e correlates with the peak height and with time-to-peak (TTP) of the time-intensity curve k ep controls the shape of the curve, reflected in the relative contributions of its independent components K trans and v e v p , when small, has little effect on the curves, but when large, results in a faster upslope, higher and earlier peak height, and faster washout of contrast, having more resemblance to the arterial input function. With fixed v e , K trans correlates with initial up-slope (\"wash-in rate\") of the time-intensity curve With fixed K trans , v e correlates with the peak height and time-to-peak of the time-intensity curve As v p increases the time-intensity curve reflects more properties of the arterial input function", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/parameters-to-images.html"}

By the late 1990s the use of fast spin echo signal generation significantly reduced imaging times and T2-FLAIR became a standard protocol for routine imaging.

On spin-echo (SE) imaging, the repetition time (TR) and the echo time ( TE ) are used to control image contrast and the \"weighting\" of the MR image. There are many misconceptions about what the term \"weighting\" actually means, so a separate Q&A is devoted to that very subject. For now we will not specifically define what we mean by \"T1-weighting\", \"T2-weighting\", or \"PD (proton-density) weighting\" other than to say that it implies that image contrast is significantly affected by T1, T2 or [H]. The traditional model in SE imaging to which the main question refers considers four combinations of TR and TE values: Short TR /Short TE  T1-W Long TR /Short TE  PD-W Long TR /Long TE  T2-W Short TR /Long TE  not used The exact reference ranges are not generally specified, but usually \"long\" TR or TE means 3-5x T1 or T2 respectively, while \"short\" implies TR or TE << T1 or T2. The overall signal intensity ( S ) of a SE sequence can be shown to be approximately where [H] is the spin (proton) density and K is a scaling factor. By considering the individual terms it is readily apparent that T1 effects are connected to TR and T2 effects are connected to TE , and that [H] effects are always present. When TE is made short compared to T2, the ratio TE/T2  0, so the T2-weighting term e TE/T2  e 0  1. In other words, T2 effects largely disappear. Conversely, when TE is made long compared to T2, the importance of the exponential weighting term increases. Another way to understand the effect of TE on T2-weighting is to consider the signals generated by two tissues with different T2 values. When TE is short, the echo occurs when there has been little time for T2-decay to have taken place and hence the tissues are not differentiated. If TE is long, the relative differences in signal decay between the two tissues become more noticeable, and hence more \"T2-weighting.\" Similar arguments can be made for the interplay between TR and T1. When TR is long compared to T1, the T1-weighting term e TR/T1  0, so T1 effects disappear. At long TR's tissues with different T1 values have all had time to recover from the 90 excitation pulse, so their signals are not dramatically different. Conversely, short TR's accentuate \"T1-weighting\". Finally, when TR is long and TE is short, both T1 and T2 effects are minimized. The only remaining factor is the spin-density [H], which becomes the dominant weighting for that combination of parameters.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/image-contrast-trte.html"}

Here the first 180-pulse suppresses CSF and the second suppresses white matter. Double IR sequence suppressing CSF and white matter. TR=11000, TE=30, TI-1=3400, TI-2=325. Black blood DIR image of heart A differently structured DIR technique producing \"black blood\" is commonly used in cardiovascular MRI. In this method, two 180-pulses are applied very close together in time. The first 180-pulse is nonselective, meaning that it inverts the magnetization for all slices within the imaging volume. The second 180-pulse, following immediately on the heels of the first 180-pulse, is slice selective, meaning it returns the magnetization of all tissues in that slice only back to the + z -direction. Thus the myocardium and other relatively stationary tissues have their signals preserved, but the blood flowing from adjacent slices has an inverted magnetization. The TI is adjusted to null the signal from inflowing blood, which appears \"black\" on magnitude reconstructed IR images. Although two 180-pulses are used, there is really only one material (blood) being inverted and hence only one TI value (measured from the time of the first inverting pulse). Thus this sequence in many ways behaves more like a single IR sequence than the DIR for brain imaging described above. It is possible to use a third (or even fourth) 180-pulse in conjunction with a black blood DIR technique. This third pulse is commonly used to suppress pericardial fat, producing a triple inversion recovery (TIR) sequence, that is a combination of STIR plus black blood DIR.

How this occurs will be the subject of several later Q&A's. More often than not, unwanted STEs occur in pulse sequences as the result of partially coherent spins subjected to multiple RF pulses.

At present we just now beginning to see AI techniques being offered as commercial products to reduce imaging time and improve image quality. Deep learning (DL) methods can be applied at one or more points along the imaging pipeline, including data acquisition and processing, channel combination, image generation, and post-processing. We will begin our discussion at the end of the pipeline (post-processing), where post-processing DL methods are used to enhance MR images only after they have been fully reconstructed by the scanner. Sites in the reconstruction pipeline where AI/DL techniques may be used. DL-based Post-processing These methods are the easiest to implement and most widely used. Also known as \"DICOM-AI\", DL-based post-processing operates in \"image space\" and makes use of a wide range of techniques already developed for photography, video, and non-medical imaging. Since it do not rely on proprietary knowledge of acquisition or reconstruction techniques, DL-based post-processing can be applied to images from any MR vendor.

Use of AI to significantly reduce gadolinium dose by a factor of 10 (from Zhu et al under CC BY) DL-based Image Acquisition and Reconstruction By comparison to post-processing methods, reconstruction-based AI has greater potential because it can utilize raw k-space data as well as other information such as coil sensitivities and phase. AI methods may even interact dynamically with the process of image acquisition. For example, AI may be used to stop image acquisition once a certain threshold has been reached or to recognize corrupted data samples and repeat them. Although generic techniques have been developed, for the most part AI-based reconstruction methods are vendor-dependent and highly proprietary. Examples include Siemens' Deep Resolve , GE's Air Recon DL , and Philips' SmartSpeed. Based on sales literature and discussions with industry insiders, these vendor-based techniques are all most useful in undersampled parallel imaging applications.

Contrast enhancement along lateral wall of LV at site of infarction. Gadolinium (Gd) - containing contrast media are widely used in cardiac MR to assess the myocardium. These agents do not enter intact myocardial cells, but distribute in the interstitial/extracellular spaces of the heart within a few minutes after intravenous injection. T1-values are shortened wherever gadolinium accumulates, resulting in high signal on T1-weighted images. Both normal and diseased myocardium will take up gadolinium contrast and exhibit enhancement. The rates of gadolinium accumulation and washout depend on multiple factors, including presence/type of heart disease, myocardial blood supply, heart rate, hematocrit, and renal function. Many diseases result in myocardial fibrosis with expansion of the extracellular compartment. As shown in the diagram below, the relative contrast enhancement between normal and diseased myocardium depends on the time after injection that imaging is performed. The relative contrast enhancement of normal and diseased myocardium depends on when imaging occurs. In the early stage (1-3 min) gadolinium resides primarily in the blood pool and normal myocardium. In later phases (5-20 min) gadolinium washes out of normal tissues but is retained by pathologic ones. In myocardial infarction, for example, both uptake and washout are slow, so late enhancement is characteristic. This is sometimes called hyper -enhancement in that both infarct and normal myocardium enhance, but the infarct enhances more. Contrast-enhancement in Ischemic Heart Disease Most patients undergoing CMR are being evaluated for possible myocardial ischemia, and several subtypes of may be distinguished according to their patterns of contrast enhancement: 1. Acute infarction with reperfusion . First pass imaging is normal, but delayed CE seen in segments where myocardial necrosis is present. 2. Acute infarction without reperfusion . This is known as microvascular obstruction (MVO) , portending a worse prognostic outcome (heart failure, recurrent infarction, etc). First pass imaging demonstrates a low-signal (nonperfused) core. Late imaging may show either no or very weak delayed enhancement. Microvascular obstruction (\"no reflow phenomenon\") 3. Stunned myocardium . The myocardial perfusion is normal on early and late contrast images, but contractile function is impaired. This carries a favorable prognosis. 4. Chronic infarction . Characterized by myocardial thinning and fibrosis, first pass imaging is normal to slightly delayed while late contrast enhancement is seen. Note that acute from chronic myocardial infarction may be difficult to distinguish by contrast-enhanced CMR alone. A section of myocardial wall with greater than 50% thickness involved by enhancing scar or fibrosis is unlikely to recover contractile function following myocardial revascularization. 5. Hibernating myocardium . These areas have decreased function and blood flow but no dead cells. They have a normal appearance on early and delayed contrast imaging and good prognosis in response to revascularization. The term \"viable myocardium\" refers to myocardium that may recover contractile function following coronary artery revascularization. Contrast-enhancement in Non-ischemic Heart Disease Patchy transmural enhancement in sarcoidosis Although late contrast enhancement is characteristic of myocardial infarction, it is not specific. Delayed myocardial enhancement occurs in a wide range of other disorders, including myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, cardiac neoplasms, and genetic diseases. The pattern of contrast enhancement may offer some clues as to whether one is dealing with an ischemic or non-ischemic process. In ischemic disease contrast enhancement begins subendocardially and spreads transmurally toward the epicardial surface. The enhancement also occurs in a distrubution corresponding to a known coronary artery territory. Conversely, contrast enhancement in non-ischemic heart disease is often located in the mid-wall of the ventricle and may be patchy or multifocal in nature.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gd-enhancement.html"}

The b-value is a factor that reflects the strength and timing of the gradients used to generate diffusion-weighted images. The higher the b -value, the stronger the diffusion effects.

The value of b is selected by the operator prior to imaging. This choice controls the degree of observed diffusion-weighting similar to the way choosing TE affects T2-weighting. Diffusion may thus be thought of as another relaxation mechanism in addition to T1 and T2. In pulse sequences without extra diffusion gradients, this relaxation mechanism is relatively unimportant, affecting the final signal by no more than 5%. When diffusion gradients are applied, however, the effects of diffusion are significantly amplified and become the dominant mechanism of tissue contrast. In a prior Q&A we showed that because diffusion is the flux of particles across a surface in a period of time, the units of D are of the form [area/time]. So that exp(bD) will be dimensionless, the units for b should be the inverse of D . In other words, b should be expressed as [time/area]. Typical b -values available on modern MRI scanners range from 0 to about 4000 s/mm. The term \" b -value\" derives from the landmark 1965 paper by Stejskal and Tanner in which they described their pulsed gradient diffusion method.

Some of this energy is then transferred to the free water pool primarily via dipole-dipole interactions. Depending on the degree of coupling between these pools, the free water pool becomes partially saturated. If the free water pool is subsequently imaged using routine RF pulses and gradients, its signal will be reduced secondary to the MT effect. The magnitude of this MT effect can be quantified by obtaining two sets of images (one with an MT pulse and one without it) and then digitally subtracting them. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) for a given voxel may then be defined and computed as: MTR = (S o  S MT )/S o where S o is the magnitude of tissue signal before the MT pulse and S MT is the signal after the MT pulse has been applied. The relative difference in signal between two adjacent tissues (A and B) is known as magnetization transfer contrast (MTC). It should be noted that MTR measurements are not absolute, are susceptible to motion-related errors, and vary significantly as a function of the shape, bandwidth, and frequency offset of the MT pulse. Notwithstanding these limitations, several useful clinical applications of MTC have been demonstrated. I personally find it helpful to think of MT pulses as \"macromolecule sat pulses\" which selectively suppress tissues with significant water-macromolecule interactions. This suppression of background tissue by MT pulses makes the technique especially useful as an adjunct to MR angiography (MRA). Small vessel detail and overall image contrast are significantly improved in time of flight (TOF) MRA when MT pulses are employed. A second potential use of MT pulses is in conjunction with contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Because gadolinium (Gd) enhancement is caused by a water-Gd ion interaction (not macromolecular cross-relaxation), MT pulses suppress the signal from background tissues and render Gd-enhanced areas more conspicuous. A third potential use of MT pulses is in conjunction with T2-weighted images when early demyelination or protein destruction may be detected before its appearance on routine images. In this application, diseased tissues with altered protein-water interactions are less suppressed by MT pulses, rendering them more conspicuous on T2-weighted images. Normal brain before (left) and after (right) MT saturation. Note the central sulcus (arrows) has different MT contrast than the other sulci. Time of flight MRA without (left) and with (right) MT suppression. Note better visualization of small vessels after MT pulse. Child with herpes encephalitis. Gadolinium enhancement is much better seen on MT image (right). Finally and surprisingly, mild to moderate MT effects are present in most MR images even when specific MT pulses have not been applied! Off-resonance excitation occurs in adjacent slices of 2D multi-slice imaging and is particularly prominent in fast spin-echo applications where multiple 180 pulses are used.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mt-imagingcontrast.html"}

Note: In this Q&A we adopt the convention that substances \"bright\" on T1-weighed images have short T1 values. This is true for most (but not all) pulse sequences. For a detailed explanation, click here . Rathke cleft cyst Frontal sinus mucocele Several clinical entities are commonly recognized where T1 shortening (and high T1 signal) occurs due to high concentrations of macromolecules. Examples include mucoceles, colloid cysts, Rathke cleft cysts, neuroenteric cysts, bronchogenic cysts, renal cysts, biliary sludge, pigment stones, and \"white\" epidermoids. Mucin . By weight composition normal mucus of the aerodigestive tract is approximately 95-98% water and 2-5% solids, with about 60% of the solid, high molecular weight component (mucin) formed by a polypeptide backbone with attached oligosaccharides. These side chains are responsible for the short T1 values either by themselves or from water-macromolecule interactions. As an interesting aside, many of these sugars are N-acetyl linked (GalNAc, GlcNAc). Hydrogen MRS of mucoceles may reveal a distinct peak at  = 2.0, mimicking the NAA peak seen in normal brain. Due to its high water content, mucus usually has CT and MR characteristics similar to water. Mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas, for example, even those with >50% mucin content, generally are not bright on T1-weighted images. However, concentrated mucus may have high attenuation values on CT (up to 130 HU) and short T1 relaxation times. A protein level of > 9 g/dl is generally required to produce high signal on T1-weighted images, but much lower concentrations give mucin-containing structures a high enough T1 signal to distinguish them from pure water. The relaxation characteristics of intraluminal mucin also depends on whether it is in more of a liquid or gelatinous/viscous phase as well as whether coexisting debris or cellular material is also present. Chemical structure of mucin, a glycoprotein with molecular weight approximately 400 kDa. The oligosaccharide (\"sugar coating\") side chains are responsible for its short T1. Hyperintense signal on T1-weighted images is commonly seen in concentrated bile and gallbladder sludge. Although biliary cholesterol has been cited as the reason for T1-shortening, this has been disproved by several H MR spectroscopy studies showing that nearly all of the MR signal in bile comes from water, not lipid protons. Mucin, however, is found in high concentrations in biliary sludge, and a water-mucin interaction seems the most likely cause. Likewise, pigmented (but not cholesterol) gallstones are bright on T1-weighted MR images, probably because they are formed on a mucin-glycoprotein matrix constituting about 25% of the stone by weight. Gallbladder sludge is bright on this T1-weighed image. T1-bright pigment gallstone Thyroid colloid is concentrated thyroglobulin. Colloid . The term colloid is non-specific and refers to a wide range of emulsions, gels, and viscous liquids whose chemical content may differ. In the thyroid, for example, colloid is generally synonymous with concentrated thyroglobulin, a 660 kDa glycoprotein containing T3 and T4 hormones. The relaxation time of various colloids will thus vary by concentration and type of substances contained therein. Chemical structure of thyoglobulin Colloid cyst of thyroid on T1 image. The physics behind T1 shortening of solutions high in proteins and/or macromolecules is more completely described in a separate Q&A (click here for link) . In brief, bonding between water and macromolecular hydrogens occurs at the interface, slowing correlation times so that a higher fraction of water protons rotate near the Larmor frequency (making T1 relaxation more efficient). Additionally, chemical exchange results in magnetization transfer between the two proton pools.

{"id": "c0ba38b8-b5ac-4b92-a2be-de6a0018bda9", "contents": "Pharmacologic Stress Several drugs are available to perform cardiac stress. Which one should I use? Three drugs are most commonly used in CMR stress-perfusion studies: adenosine, regadenoson, and dobutamine. The first two (adenosine and regadenoson) are vasodilators, while the latter (dobutamine) is a positive inotrope used to directly assess myocardial contractility. Adenosine Adenosine is a potent vasodilator of the coronary and most other vascular beds (except hepatic and renal), acting through nonselective stimulation of A 1 , A 2A , A 2B , and A 3 receptors. A 2A receptors dilate high-resistance myocardial arterioles, allowing stress-induced ischemic regions caused by epicardial coronary artery stenosis to be identified. Adenosine The standard adult dose of adenosine is 140 g/kg/min administered by continuous IV infusion over about 4 minutes. Gadolinium is usually injected during the final minute of adenosine infusion through a separate IV line (the two drugs are chemically incompatible). Common side effects of adenosine include mild-to-moderate (<10 mmHg) reduction in blood pressure with a reflex increase in heart rate. Mild dyspnea occurs in about 15%. Due to direct depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, heart block or bradycardia may occur. Significant drop in blood pressure, severe respiratory difficulty, or persistent/symptomatic AV block are grounds for termination of the infusion. Due to its short half-life (4-10 seconds), most complications of adenosine will spontaneously resolve. Occasionally aminophylline (250 mg by slow IV infusion with EKG monitoring) is required for treatment. Significant complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and death are rare but have reported. Contraindications for adenosine include recent (< 3 days old) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, second or third degree AV block, and asthma/emphysema/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It should be given with caution to patients with valvular stenosis, autonomic dysfunction, or cerebrovascular insufficiency. Regadenoson Regadenoson is a systemic vasodilator with similar structure and function to adenosine. However, regadenoson is a selective A 2A receptor agonist, thus avoiding the undesirable negative inotropic (A 1 ) and bronchoconstrictive (A 2B and A 3 ) effects of adenosine. It is thus the stress CMR drug of choice for patients with asthma or obstructive airways disease. Regadenoson Regadenoson is marketed under the tradename Lexiscan and is significantly more expensive than generic adenosine. It is supplied in pre-filled 5 mL syringes containing a \"standard\" 0.4 mg dose given to all adults independent of body weight. Bolus IV injection is performed over 10 seconds followed by a saline flush. To allow time for circulation and onset of action, a waiting period of about 2 minutes should be allowed between regadenoson injection and stress imaging/administration of gadolinium. Although it has a lower incidence of respiratory side-effects, regadenoson poses the same risks and has the same contraindications as adenosine. Regadenoson has a significantly longer half-life than adenosine. Although peak coronary vasodilatation occurs in the first 5 minutes, systemic pharmacologic effects may last for 30 minutes or longer. Thus, nonspecific vasodilatory side effects such as headache may last longer and be more severe with regadenoson than adenosine. Dobutamine Dobutamine is a synthetic catecholamine whose primary effect is to stimulate  1 receptors of the sympathetic nervous system. In the heart it produces coronary vasodilatation, increased myocardial contractility (positive inotropic effect), and increased heart rate (positive chronotropic effect). Dobutamine Dobutamine causes myocardial cells to contract harder and faster, resulting in increased myocardial oxygen demand and blood flow. It has been used for stress echocardiography since the early 1980's and for stress CMR since the early 1990's. As with the vasodilatory agents (adenosine and regadenoson), dobutamine may reveal wall motion and perfusion abnormalities not apparent in the non-stressed state. Contraindications to dobutamine include marked arterial hypertension ( 220/120 mmHg), severe aortic stenosis, acute aortic dissection, unstable angina, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, complex cardiac arrhythmias, and severe congestive heart failure. As atropine is often given in conjunction with dobutamine to increase heart rate, patients with closed-angle glaucoma, myasthenia gravis, and obstructive uropathy should also be excluded from dobutamine stress protocols. Dobutamine is a potentially dangerous drug, and life-threatening complications occur in approximately 1:500 cardiac patients subjected to high-dose (20-40 g/kg/min) regimens. Reported adverse events include sustained ventricular tachycardia and other arrhythmias, coronary spasm, myocardial infarction, cardiac rupture, and systemic hypotension. Because of these significant risks high-dose dobutamine CMR has gradually fallen out of favor during the last decade, being replaced by stress testing using vasodilators. Nevertheless there are still arguments for the use of high-dose dobutamine CMR (see", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/stess-drugsagents.html"}

In the last several Q&A's, we have finally developed a background to understand how a convolutional neural network (CNN) is constructed. In this Q&A we will try to put the pieces all together, expanding on the diagram below representative of a series-type CNN (like VGGNet ) whose input might be an MR image and output a disease prediction/classification. A simple CNN for disease classification Convolution Convolution of the input image is the initial step in a CNN. As described in the prior Q&A , convolution involves a sliding multiplication and addition of regional data points by a small (typically 3x3 or 5x5) array of numbers called a kernel or filter . By using sets of different kernels (such as ones that emphasize edges or shapes) a set of regional feature maps is produced. Note that during training of the network, the filters at each layer will change gradually until they are optimized for the particular purpose intended (e.g., segmentation, classification). First-level feature maps of a brain MRI extracted from a convolutional network. Each small image is the result of convolution with one of 64 different first-level filters that emphasize various simple properties, including bright vs dark regions, edges, curves, and shadows. Activation An activation function is also commonly applied during feature map generation to constrain output pixels to a certain range. As described in a prior Q&A , a common choice is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function that passes through only positive values to the feature map and sets all negative pixels to zero. Appearance of one of the above 64 feature maps before and after application of ReLU activation function Pooling (Downsampling) The next step, pooling , shrinks the size of each feature map by 75% or more. This allows only the most important features to be retained, thus reducing the number of learnable features of the model. With fewer parameters, pooling helps prevent overfitting of data. Pooling also reduces spatial invariance, meaning the network is able to recognize features even though they may be distorted or rotated. Max vs Average Pooling with a 2x2 matrix The most popular method is known as Max Pooling and uses a 2x2 filter to operate on each feature map. As shown in the illustration, the Max Pooling filter takes the largest value from each group of 4 pixels, thus shrinking the image substantially. A second common method is Average (Avg) Pooling , where the average value from each group of 4 pixels is taken. Other techniques include Min Pooling, Global Pooling, Stochastic Pooling, and 1-2 Norm Pooling. Max and average pooling of feature map using a 2x2 matrix Convolution, Activation, and Pooling ..... Repeat The convolution-pooling process may be repeated several times, producing ever smaller \"feature of feature\" maps. Pooling is not always performed after each convolution; in some networks several convolutions are performed followed by a pooling step. A common question that arises is what to these inner networks doing and what do deeper level feature maps look like? Although the results depend upon the particular network under consideration and filters selected, the following statements generally apply: The initial feature maps reflect the presence of lines, edges, and simple regions of light and dark within localized areas of the original image spanned by the convolution kernel. Subsequent early layers are sensitive to curved contours and the junction of lines, recognizing loops and corners. Ultimately whole shapes like rectangles and circles may arise. Deeper convolutions produce maps sensitive to texture and surfaces. With progressive convolutions and pooling, the feature maps become progressively smaller and coarser. They are no longer localized but contain information from all parts of the original image. These nested \"features of features\" maps may become largely unrecognizable to our eyes, reflecting hidden patterns and relationships between objects detected at earlier stages. With training the filter weightings are modified to become optimized for the specific task required. The image and Deep Visualization Toolbox video by Jason Yosinki below may help you get a better feeling about what the computer is \"seeing\" in these deeper layers. Original image and feature maps after 1 to 15 convolutions. (Adapted from Yosinski under CC-BY) Final Processing Steps Many possibilities exist once the multiple convolution-pooling process is complete. One common final stage , known as vectorization or flattening , converts the last 2-dimensional feature maps into a single long chain of numbers (i.e., a \"vector\"). The vectorized feature maps then serve as inputs into a fully connected neural network whose output can be used to produce a final \"decision\" (such as tissue segmentation or disease classification). The fully connected layers allow the system to combine various combinations of information from the vectorized feature maps in making the system's end result. To have statistical meaning, the raw data in the output vector must be transformed into probabilities by use of the Softmax function (described in more detail in the next Q&A ). Alternatively, the fully pooled data may be re-expanded back to its original dimensions, a process known as up-pooling, outlined in the a subsequent Q&A. Typical final processing steps in a CNN used for image classification/segmentation. Vectorized feature maps are passed through several fully connected layers to produce a numerical output vector ( Z ). The Softmax function converts these raw numbers into probabilities.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/convolutional-network.html"}

{"id": "f7c7c6dd-7e51-4109-b93d-9eedf40b74f2", "contents": "Specifications for Gradients The MR sales representative is telling me about his scanner's strong gradients. How do I interpret the specification sheet? Key gradient specifications: Slew rate is defined as Peak gradient strength  Rise time. Both spatial resolution and imaging speed depend upon good gradient performance, and scanners do differ in their gradient specifications. Electrical currents are pulsed on and off during imaging, and gradients typically have a trapezoidal waveform as shown in the diagram to the left from which various measurements are derived. The first value to look for on the specification sheet is maximum (or peak) gradient strength . This is quoted in units of millitesla per meter (mT/m). Most 1.5T to 3.0T superconducting whole body scanners have maximum gradient strengths in the range of 30-45 mT/m, while lower field (<0.5T) permanent scanners are in the 15-25 mT/m range. For the best performance concerning peak gradient strength, bigger is better. Rise time is measured in milliseconds, and is typically in the range of 0.1-0.3 msec for most scanners. Rise time is meaningless by itself, because a scanner with very weak gradients might ramp up to full strength very quickly, but have overall poor gradient performance for imaging. What is important is not the absolute value of rise time, but rise time scaled according to the maximum achievable gradient strength. This is encapsulated in the slew rate , defined as Slew Rate = Peak Gradient Strength  Rise Time Slew rates are measured in units of Tesla per meter per second (T/m/s). Thus a gradient that ramps from 0 to peak amplitude of 30 mT/m in 0.5 msec would have a slew rate of 60 T/m/s. The slew rate influences the minimum attainable TR and TE for conventional MR imaging and influences the echo spacing in fast spin echo and echo planar applications. In the current marketplace, high field superconducting scanners boast slew rates in the 150-200 T/m/s range; superconducting open scanners in the 100-120 T/m/s range; and lower field permanent scanners on the order of 50 T/m/s. The need for strong gradients and high slew rates depends on your intended scanner use. If cardiac or brain imaging is anticipated, then powerful gradients are mandatory. If the intended scanner use is for orthopedics, however, such demanding gradients may not be required. Caveat emptor: The typical gradient strengths and slew rates quoted above are per axis (i.e. values for the x -, y - and z -gradients individually ). Some vendors, often those with somewhat inferior gradient performance, will instead quote effective gradient strengths and slew rates. Because three gradients are averaged together, the effective gradient strength and slew rates are 1.73 (= 3) times larger than the per axis values. An additional gradient parameter commonly measured is duty cycle . The duty cycle does not have a fixed value, but varies by pulse sequence. It represents the percent of time the gradient is able to work at maximum amplitude during that sequence. Maximum duty cycle performance of close to 100% should be expected for most modern scanners.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gradient-specifications.html"}

{"id": "888538ec-38c3-43c4-a33f-dc82f42d2df3", "contents": "GRE Sequences There are so many different GRE sequences. Can you make sense of these? Gradient echo (GRE) sequences begin as a regularly spaced series of radiofrequency (RF)-pulses repeated at time interval TR . These RF-pulses are often chosen to have flip angles () less than 90, but can have any value. A train of evenly spaced RF pulses produce \"FID-like\" and \"Echo-like\" signals. Each RF-pulse generates a free induction decay (FID) signal immediately after it is applied. The FID decays with time constant T2* that reflects both natural/true/intrinsic T2-relaxation plus accelerated signal loss due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Each pair of RF-pulses generates a spin echo (SE) , that because of regular spacing of the RF-pulse train, forms and rises to a maximum exactly a the time of the next RF-pulse. Each set of three RF-pulses also generate stimulated echoes (STEs) that coincide with the spin echoes. The \"Echo\" portion of the GRE sequence is mostly T2-weighted with fewer T2* effects. After many RF-pulses the two signal components reach a steady-state and begin to lose their original identities as discrete FIDs and SE/STEs. In fact, both result from the summation of echoes and magnetization created from multiple prior cycles For this reason some authors prefer to denote them as S+ and S- , or use more generic terms such as \"post-excitation\" and \"pre-excitation\" signals, respectively. For the purposes of this web site I will stay with the older nomenclature, continuing to refer to them as \"FIDs\" and \"Echoes\". Perhaps \"FID-like\" and \"Echo-like\" would be more appropriate. An interesting phenomenon occurs within an RF-pulse train if TR is made much shorter than T2. Here the \"FID\" following each RF-pulse does not completely die out before the \"Echo\" component begins to form. In this situation the transverse signal never completely disappears and the result is called a steady-state free precession (SSFP) . A steady-state free precession exists when TR is short, the tails of the \"FIDs\" merging with the rising edges of the \"Echoes\". Creation of a GRE by manipulation of spin phases by an external magnetic gradient field. The gradient is typically applied with two polarities, for dephasing and rephasing spins respectively. Either of the signals generated by the RF-pulse train (\"FIDs\" or \"Echoes\") can be temporarily suppressed and then made to reappear at a chosen time ( TE ) by application of an external magnetic gradient field. The gradient is typically applied in two steps: 1) a dephase portion that forces spins out of phase, and 2) a rephase portion that brings them back into phase as the GRE. By changing the timing, strength, and duration of the gradients it is possible to refocus either the \"FID\", the \"Echo\", or both at a specified times as the GRE. This is possible because the dephasing gradient field simply \"scrambled\" the spin phases in a predictable, organized fashion. By reversing this gradient the signal can be regenerated (except for non-gradient-related T2* decay). This gives rise to the alternative translation of the GRE acronym, \"gradient recalled echo.\" A first-level classification of GRE sequences based on which signal (\"FID\", \"Echo\", or both) is sampled can now be made: GRE with \"FID\" refocusing (FISP, GRASS, FFE) GRE with \"Echo\" refocusing (PSIF, SSFP, T2-FFE) GRE with combined \"FID\" and \"Echo\" refocusing (True FISP, FIESTA, Balanced FFE) By carefully structuring of the the gradients and phases of the RF-pulses is is possible to either: 1) nurture/preserve these transverse coherences, or 2) disrupt or prevent them from forming. This leads to a second classification scheme for GRE sequences based on how transverse coherences are handled: Coherent GRE sequences : preservation of transverse coherences Spoiled GRE sequences : complete disruption of transverse coherences", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/types-of-gre-sequences.html"}

Spin-phase effects refer to changes in precession angle (phase) that protons undergo when they move within a gradient. An important function of magnetic field gradients is to spatially encode the MR signal. If a proton changes position while these gradients are applied, it will gain or lose phase compared to stationary tissue. In routine imaging, spin-phase effects are primarily responsible for signal loss for in-plane flow and in regions of vascular turbulence. Not purely a destructive phenomenon, spin-phase effects can also be quantified and used to create MR angiograms and measure vascular or CSF flow. Low signal of in-plane arterial flow due to spin-phase effects To gain appreciation for the magnitude of spin-phase effects, let us calculate the phase gained by a proton moving through a magnetic field gradient. For simplicity, we will assume that the proton moves at constant velocity ( v ) for time ( t ) within a gradient having constant magnitude G . The position of the proton will then be x = vt and its resonant offset frequency, f, will be a linear function of time that is given by f = Gx = Gvt Because total phase gain is the sum of incremental frequency changes over time, the net phase shift of this proton, (t) , can be written (t) =  f dt = ( Gvt) dt = Gv  t dt = Gvt This equation thus demonstrates an important (but nonintuitive) concept: the phase shift experienced by a moving spin will be proportional to its velocity, the strength of the applied gradient, and the square of the length of time it moves within that gradient.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/spin-phase-effects.html"}

This calibration step involves the adjustment of receiver amplifier gain with respect to the maximum MR signal occurring during imaging. If the attenuator value is set too low (i.e., receiver gain is set too high), then the signal will overload the analog-to-digital converter, and data clipping will occur. Since the largest peaks of the MR signal typically are the low order phase-encode steps at the center of k-space, data clipping interferes with image contrast. The result is an image with an \"eerie\" appearance as show right. If the receive attenuator is set too high, then receiver gain will be insufficient, and image noise will increase. The scanner automatically calibrates receive attenuation by running a mock pulse sequence identical to that specified for imaging, except that the phase-encode gradient is set to zero (When the phase-encode gradient is zero, signal is maximal).

If this is so, then why aren't chemical shift artifacts seen in the phase-encode direction also? It is indeed true that the chemical shift between water and fat protons produces both a frequency shift and a phase shift between the two species. In routine spin-warp imaging , however, the resulting extra phase of fat protons relative to water protons does not accumulate from one phase-encoding step to the next. The differential phase shift between water and fat is therefore constant at a given location between successive phase-encoding steps. Since the Fourier transform takes into account the phase difference in assigning spatial location to a signal in this direction, no water-fat misregistration will occur along the phase-encoding axis in routine spin-echo or gradient-echo imaging. EPI image with chemical shift artifact in PE direction () In echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) with Cartesian sampling , however, the opposite phenomenon occurs. Here, chemical-shift artifacts are minimal in the frequency-encode direction but may be extremely large in the phase-encode direction! The reason for this difference between spin-warp and echo-planar techniques lies in the way data is collected in the latter. In EPI all the lines of raw data are collected immediately following a single RF excitation. The bandwidth per pixel in the frequency-encode direction is relatively large (i.e., on the order of 1500 Hz), so that chemical-shift artifacts are not noticeable. In the phase-encode direction, however, the bandwidth per pixel is extremely small (i.e., on the order of 10 Hz), since all the phase-encode lines are acquired in a time frame on the order of 100 msec. At 1.5T the fat/water chemical shift is about 220 Hz, and this low bandwidth in the phase-encode direction is translated into a noticeable artifact that can be up to 1-3 cm in width (depending on parameters chosen). Special corrections and modifications to the echo-planar technique must be made to minimize the fat signal and eliminate this artifact.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/chemical-shift-in-phase.html"}

Terms such as \"T1-weighted\" and \"T2-weighted\" are among the most overused and least understood concepts in MR imaging. In the broadest sense, these terms are used to communicate to other physicians the type of MR pulse sequence employed to generate a series of images. In a more narrow sense an implication exists that a single intrinsic tissue parameter (T1, T2, spin-density (  ), diffusion, susceptibility, chemical shift, flow, perfusion, etc.) dominates the image contrast observed. T2-FLAIR image Medical students and non-radiologists are often taught to look at the the \"color\" of CSF or other fluids to determine the type of \"weighting\"  dark CSF means \"T1-weighting\" and bright CSF means \"T2-weighting\". Although this simple scheme may have worked 20 years ago, consider the brain image from the commonly used T2-FLAIR sequence pictured left. This sequence is known to have strong sensitivity to T2 changes, but the CSF signal has been suppressed by an inverting pulse and rendered black! A fundamental misconception about \"T1,T2,  , etc -weighting\", is that contrast in the image is dominated by one specific tissue parameter to the exclusion of all others. To show the fallacy of this reasoning I developed an index system to quantify the relative contributions of these parameters on routine spin-echo brain imaging. The results were surprising, and showed among other things: Spin density (  ) contrast is always present, contributing 30-50% of the contrast effect on both short TR /short TE (traditionally called \"T1-weighted\") and long TR /long TE (\"T2-weighted) images. Short TR /short TE sequences often have as much \"T2-weighting\" as they do \"T1-weighting\". Long TR /long TE images do not have much \"T1-weighting\" but do have significant \" - weighting\" in addition to \"T2-weighting\". The degree of \"weighting\" is not the same for all tissues in a given image. Another common misconception is that T1-weighted or T2-weighted images are parameter \"maps\" whose pixel intensities are proportional to tissue T1 or T2 values. This is patently incorrect. Actual T1 and T2 maps are shown left so the reader may appreciate how different they appear compared to routine T1- or T2-weighted images.

To date the only manganese-based contrast agent ever approved for worldwide sales and clinical use was mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP), marketed in the 1990's under the tradename Teslascan. Due to low sales, poor clinical performance, and concerns over toxicity, Teslascan was withdrawn from the US market in 2003 and from the EU in 2010. After gadolinium, the transition metal manganese ( 25 Mn) possesses the second highest paramagnetic moment of any element. This property derives from the Mn +2 ion having 5 unpaired electrons in its 3d shell. Thus the potential of using manganese at the center of a paramagnetic contrast agent has always excited considerable interest. After injection Teslascan is taken up by hepatocytes and eventually excreted into the bowel. Accumulation of manganese produces a prominent T1 shortening effect, rendering normal liver bright on T1-weighted images, while non-hepatocyte-containing masses remain dark. Use of Teslascan to better delineate liver lesions. Noncontrast T1WI (left) shows 3 poorly defined liver metastases (arrows). Post Teslascan T1WI shows them to much better advantage. (From Schima et al under CC-BY) Although initial clinical trials of Teslascan demonstrated a low incidence of mild and expected adverse effects (headache, nausea, etc.), concern about the dangers of the free Mn +2 ion arose. In industrial workers Mn +2 is known to accumulate in the brain with long-term exposure producing a Parkinson-like syndrome. This risk is increased in patients with liver failure. Reports of myocardial depression also arose resulting from Mn +2 entering heart cells through Ca +2 channels. I personally believe Mn-based contrast agents may still find a place in future pharmacopoeias, provided attention is given to developing chelating agents that attach more strongly to the metal and prevent release of the toxic free ion. Considerable research interest in animals continues, including its use in MR mapping of cytoarchitecture and neuronal projections as well as assessing cardiac viability.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding The first (and to my knowledge only fatal event) occurring in an MRI patient with a cerebral aneurysm clip occurred in Texas in 1993. The details of this case are worth reviewing, as they provide some lessons for MR safety. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage from movement of a ferromagnetic aneurysm clip (From Radiology 1993; 187:855) The patient was a 74-year-old woman who was known to have an aneurysm clip implanted 15 years previously at another institution. Not knowing the nature of the clip, the MR Center originally refused to perform the scan. The patient's family directly contacted the neurosurgeon who placed the clip, reporting back that the implant was a \"Yasargil clip\" (known to be \"MR Compatible\"). The MRI was scheduled, and as the patient reached a point about 4 feet from the bore of the 1.5T magnet, she complained of a severe headache. She was transferred to the emergency room where a massive intracranial hemorrhage was noted. At autopsy a tear in the arterial wall was found at the site of clip placement with fresh blood. Upon removal and inspection, the clip was found not to be a \"Yasargil\" but rather a \"Codman Sundt-Kees Vari-Angle Clip\" known to be highly ferromagnetic and contraindicated for MRI. This was confirmed in the original operative note obtained posthumously from microfilm. The lesson we all learned from this is that you cannot simply take the word of a patient or family member about the identity of an aneurysm clip (or other implant). You need to see the actual implant card or operative note with specific information (e.g., manufacturer, type/model, lot/serial number) before making a decision about MR safety. Fortunately, ferromagnetic cerebral aneurysm clips have not been manufactured since the mid-1980s, and thus will rarely be encountered in patients today. All modern aneurysm clips are composed of titanium titanium-alloys, MP35N (nickel/chromium/cobalt), Elgiloy/Phynox (cobalt/nickel/iron) or other non- or at most minimally ferromagnetic properties. Thus virtually any cerebral aneurysm clip implanted in the last 25 years will be MR compatible at least up to 3.0T. Historical List of MR Unsafe Aneurysm Clips Today a significant fraction of intracranial aneurysms are treated endovascularly with detachable coils and stents. Their composition is typically platinium, Nitinol, or platinium-irridium.

The \"dark rim\" artifact refers to a band of transient low signal in the endocardium during the early phases of a myocardial perfusion study. As pictured below, it is seen during the time when gadolinium first enters the left ventricle. The phenomenon is temporary, not being present after myocardial enhancement has occurred. While easily recognized by radiologists and cardiologists interpreting these studies, the transient dark rim could affect the results of automated or semiautomated measurements such as those used for up-slope analysis or parameter modeling. Dark rim artifact (arrows) in subendocardial area in phase-encode direction immediately after gadolinium enters the left ventricle. Dark rim has disappeared within a few heartbeats confirming that it does not represent ischemia. The cause of the dark rim artifact is not fully established, but now believed primarily to be a manifestation of motion artifact superimposed on the Gibbs (or truncation) phenomenon . As described in a separate Q&A , the Gibbs phenomenon is seen at high contrast interfaces, such as between the brain and spinal cord (or in this case, between the myocardium and gadolinium-containing LV blood). It occurs primarily in the phase-encode direction due to sampling an inadequate number of spatial frequencies in the Fourier representation. Secondary contributing factors to the artifact may include susceptibility effect, motion, and intravoxel phase cancellations. The dark rim artifact may be reduced by the following technical choices: 1) minimize Gibbs effect by improving image resolution via increasing number of phase-encoding lines and using parallel imaging; 2) minimize susceptibility effects by reducing contrast dose and avoiding bSSFP sequences; and 3) minimize motion artifacts via sequential k-space ordering and parallel imaging. The more general question commonly arises: How do you know you are seeing a true perfusion defect during a first-pass study and not some sort of artifact? The answer is \"experience\", but the following criteria may be helpful as a starting point. A true perfusion defect typically has the following characteristics: It is present in at least 3-4 frames during peak passage of the Gd bolus It has consistent size from frame to frame It corresponds to a known coronary artery distribution Conversely, artifacts such as the \"dark rim\" do not meet these criteria.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dark-rim-artifact.html"}

Although the vast majority of published fMRI studies are carefully conducted, some contain serious statistical or design flaws raising doubts about their validity. At times it seems that these \"junk\" papers are the very ones most likely to be picked up by the popular press! Because methodological errors can be difficult to recognize, I believe it is wise to initially view all fMRI studies with a critical eye toward their design, analysis, and conclusions. A few of the more common errors and pitfalls are described below. Statistical Errors Leading to High False Positive Rates All fMRI studies must strike a delicate balance between excluding false positives (saying an area activates when it does not) and accepting false negatives (considering an area to be silent when it really does activate). The harder you protect against one type of error, the more you will have of the other. The false positive rate is typically controlled at the voxel level by selection of an arbitrary p-value threshold. In non -fMRI experiments p = 0.05 (i.e., allowing 5% false positives) is often considered a reasonable choice. However, such a modest p -value proves grossly inadequate for fMRI studies where 100,000 or more voxels must be simultaneously tested. If the p -value were set to 0.05 for a single voxel, then as many as 5000 of the 100,000 total voxels in a study (100,000 x 0.05) would potentially appear falsely activated. This issue is known in statistics as the multiple comparisons problem and is amenable to several correction strategies that reduce the effective p -value to 0.001 or below. False positive fMRI activation in the brain of a dead salmon (Courtesy of Craig Bennett) Surprisingly, many early fMRI papers did not make appropriate statistical corrections for multiple comparisons. This issue was brought to light by Craig Bennett in his famous fMRI study of a dead salmon \"viewing\" photos of human faces. False positive activation was detected in the salmon's brain when multiple comparison statistics were not properly performed. Bennett and his salmon sufficiently shamed the neuroimaging community so that multiple comparison corrections are now nearly universally employed for fMRI analysis. But just as this statistical error has been put to rest, another has recently surfaced. In 2016 Eklund et al. r eported that several commonly used methods of cluster analysis resulted in significant inflation of false positive results. One of the most popular algorithms (AFNI's 3dClust Sim) was even discovered to contain an unrecognized 15-year-old software \"bug\" (now corrected). The implications are staggering -- improper cluster analysis may potentially affect conclusions from up to 40,000 fMRI studies published between 2000 and 2015. Test-Retest Unreliability In 2020 major meta-analyses of task-based fMRI studies were published by two independent groups of investigators. In one paper the same fMRI dataset was given to 70 different experienced groups world-wide to analyze and test hypotheses about, with astonishingly different results. Both papers came to the same conclusion -- that the test-retest reliability of task-based fMRI was very poor, far below recommended cutoff levels for clinical application or individual test comparisons. The second paper led its Duke researcher author to question 15 years of his own work. One commentator wrote, \"The dead salmon has lots of company\". Circularity Errors (\"Voodoo Correlations\") In 2009 Vul et al. pointed out that more than 50 high-profile publications linking fMRI activation with measures of emotion, personality, and social cognition demonstrated unbelievably high (\"voodoo\") correlation values. A careful analysis of experimental methods provided the explanation  many investigators first preselected groups of voxels appearing to be the most active and then performed statistical analysis on these voxels only. Because the reported voxels were not truly independent, the calculated correlation values were falsely elevated. The methodological error is a form of circular reasoning that can still be encountered in fMRI studies. Voxels or regions of interest should always be selected before (not after) the experiment has been conducted. Other fMRI Pitfalls and Fallacies Below are a few additional potential errors, pitfalls, and reminders to consider before blindly accepting the conclusions of an fMRI experiment: Voxels that fail to reach the statistical threshold for significance are not necessarily inactive, as most fMRI studies are only weakly powered with high false negative rates. Statistical significance does not imply causation. Analysis of pooled data from multiple subjects is filled with potential statistical pitfalls and suffers from imprecise anatomical localization. Beware studies using either very high or very low statistical thresholds. Very high (strict) thresholds tend to collapse activation into just a few dominant regions and favor sensorimotor paradigms (which have intrinsically stronger responses than cognitive or emotive ones). Very low thresholds allow in far too many false positives which may may go unrecognized if techniques such as white matter masking are employed Reverse inference experiments are treacherous to interpret. Some areas of the brain are associated with diverse and even conflicting emotions such as pain, fear, love, worry, and anticipation.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fmri-critique.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Breast imaging specialists are often asked to place a wire, clip, or other marker to locate a site for future surgical biopsy or to document the site of a percutaneous biopsy. The vast majority of these localizations are done under mammography or ultrasound guidance, with MRI reserved only for lesions difficult to see on other modalities. Most wires and markers in common use were developed before the widespread availability of breast MRI. As such, many have either not been formally tested by ASTM methods (though are likely of little risk to the patient because of their small size and deep locations). A devices few have been found to be \"MR Unsafe\", especially several types of biopsy guns and aspiration equipment. Fortunately, many new MR-compatible wire, marker and biopsy systems have been developed over the last two decades rendering most of these concerns moot. Wires for Breast Biopsy Metallic wires, often ending with barbs or hooks, are commonly placed in suspicious lesions to guide the surgeon at open biopsy. These wires are typically placed on the morning of the planned surgery, and at the request of the surgeon, sometimes include the trocar or guiding needle in place taped to the skin. If not MRI compatible, these devices could conceivably cause heating or skin burns (like any juxtacutaneous metal object). But since patients nearly always go to surgery shortly after wire/hook placement, it is distinctly rare that they undergo MRI before the wire has been removed. In the highly unusual case that one does encounter a patient with a protruding wire or needle, it is important to check the manufacturer's website to establish MR compatibility. Considerable care should be undertaken with exact reference to the manufacturer/wire name/diameter/length/SKU. For example, BD-Bard currently sells 14 wires with exactly the same name (Ghiatas Beaded Breast Biopsy Localization Wire) but with different materials, lengths, diameters; only 4 of the 14 are MRI compatible!

These are typically made of (nonferromagnetic) titanium, stainless steel, or other alloys. They are now commonly placed even in mammography or ultrasound so that future MRIs will not be impaired.

Sir Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur, Winners of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, 2003 During the first half of the 20th Century Isador Rabi, Felix Bloch, and Edward Purcell described the NMR phenomenon; but it was the next generation of scientists in the 1970's who discovered how to create images from the NMR signal. Primary credit (and the Nobel Prize) for MR i maging was awarded to Sir Peter Mansfield and Paul Lauterbur . However, Raymond Damadian must also be recognized for his innovation and construction of the first full-body human MR scanner. Lauterbur's Contribution: Projectional NMR Tomography Paul Lauterbur (1909-2007), a chemist working at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, published the first true MR image in Nature in March, 1973. His experimental setup involved two 1-mm-diameter tubes filled with water placed in an 1.4T magnet. Applying magnetic field gradients rotated successively by 45, he was able to obtain four different 1-dimensional projections of the NMR signal. These data were then mathematically \"back-projected\" to form a 2-dimensional tomographic image. Because the result depended on the combined effects of two magnetic fields, Lauterbur named his technique \" zeugmatography \" after the Greek word, zeugma , meaning \"that which is used for joining.\" Shortly thereafter, Lauterbur produced crude images of his first living subject: a tiny clam.

(Images courtesy of Andrew Webb through Joshua Shimony) Mansfield's Contribution: Use of a field gradient for slice selection From Mansfield (1973). Five peaks corresponding to five stacked blocks of solid camphor. Also in 1973, Peter Mansfield (1933-2017), a physicist working at the University of Nottingham, demonstrated how a linear field gradient could be used to localize the NMR signal on a slice-by-slice basis. Mansfield's experimental setup involved stacking multiple 1-mm-thick sheets of solid camphor into the bore of an NMR spectrometer. Applying a magnetic field gradient perpendicular to the sheets, Mansfield measured the transient NMR signal response to an applied RF-pulse. Interference peaks similar to those seen in x-ray diffraction were observed, which when inverse Fourier transformed revealed discrete layers of the camphor sample. Later in the decade, Mansfield and his collaborator, Andrew Maudsley, further refined this method into a line-scan technique, producing the first image of a human body part, a finger, in 1977. Line-scan technique, selectively irradiating a narrow strip with an isolated slice of magnetization.

Damadian's Contribution: Vision of a human-sized scanner to detect disease Raymond V. Damadian Assistant Larry Minkoff in Indomitable While Lauterbur and Mansfield were basic scientists, Raymond V. Damadian (b. 1936) was a physician, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the State University of New York - Brooklyn (Downstate). He looked at NMR from a different and original perspective  as a phenomenon that might be used to probe the body and diagnose human disease. In one of his landmark early papers ( Science , 1971) Damadian demonstrated that cancer cells had longer T1 and T2 values than normal cells. In 1972 he filed a US patent application for an apparatus and method to detect cancer in tissue. Although the details of exactly how this 'apparatus\" would produce images were not included in the application, Damadian and his team set out to build such a device which was named \" Indomitable .\" By mid-summer, 1977, the first whole-body MR images were being produced, including the famous one shown below of his assistant's chest. Damadian's 1972 patent application Damadian used a \"sensitive point\" method for spatial localization of the NMR signal. This was based on a saddle-shaped magnetic field where only a small volume at the center matched the resonance frequency of the RF pulse. The patient's body was physically moved in a rectangular pattern until signals from all pixels were obtained. First whole body image (Minkoff's chest), obtained July, 1977. It required nearly 5 hours to produce. Damadian called his imaging method \"field-focused NMR\" or FONAR. This became the name of his company, the first to manufacture clinical MR scanners commercially. It was soon recognized that the field-focused method was far too slow and clumsy for routine clinical imaging, and so it was abandoned in favor of the methods of Lauterbur and Mansfield in subsequent versions of the scanner. When the 2003 Nobel Prizes for Medicine were announced, Damadian considered it a personal injustice that he was excluded. He placed full-page ads in several large world newspapers urging the Nobel committee to change its mind. The decision stood.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/who-invented-mri.html"}

For the purposes of this question, I have limited \"dangerous\" to refer to the attraction/movement of metal objects by the main magnetic field (Bo). Interaction effects of metals with gradient and RF magnetic fields due to electrical conductivity are discussed elsewhere. Alnico permanent magnet Metals possessing ferromagnetism are strongly attracted to a static magnetic field and present the greatest danger to patients and staff in the MRI environment. As described in a prior Q&A , ferromagnetism is a property of certain elemental solids and alloys that form magnetic domains in which arrays of electron spins become locked together in alignment. Iron and its alloys are the most commonly used ferromagnetic materials. Although the Latin root \"ferro-\" refers to \"iron\", several non-iron metals can also possess ferromagnetism  cobalt, nickel, chromium, manganese, and various rare earth elements. Steels Most of the dangerous ferromagnetic objects encountered in the MR environment are made of steel. Steel is an alloy of iron to which a small percentage of carbon has been added to improve strength and fracture resistance. Other metals are also commonly added to increase hardness and durability, including nickel, manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and vanadium. Hundreds of different steel varieties exist tailored for specific purposes. Most steels are highly ferromagnetic, but the degree of ferromagnetism depends upon the concentration and types of alloyed elements, as well the specific crystal structure resulting from the manufacturing process. Stainless steels contain at least 10.5% chromium, which confers them with significant resistance to corrosion. Two MR-relevant subtypes of stainless steel should be recognized: Martensitic (ferritic) stainless steels are highly ferromagnetic due to their body-centered cubic crystal structure. Typified by the 400 Series, these hardened stainless steels are widely used for medical and surgical equipment. Austenitic stainless steels contain 8-14% nickel, producing a face-centered cubic crystal structure, rendering them essentially \"non-magnetic\". In 1990 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all steel medical implants to be made of austenitic 300 Series stainless steel. The low-carbon type 316L is commonly used for stents, wires, plates, clips, and screws. It should be noted that the magnetic properties of steels can be difficult to predict, as the process of cooling, annealing, deforming, cold working, and welding can change the crystal structure from non-ferromagnetic to ferromagnetic forms. This may potentially even occur to a minor degree if a non-ferromagnetic wire, plate, rod, or nail is hammered or bent during surgery. Permanent Magnets Permanently magnetized components are found in certain implants, including dentures, maxillofacial prostheses, hearing devices, tissue expanders, artificial sphincters, and orthopedic rods. Because of their strength-to-size ratio and biocompatibility, nearly all of these are \"rare-earth\" magnets, either Samarium-cobalt (SmCo 5 ) or Neodymium alloy (Nd 2 Fe 14 B). Some dental and facial devices utilize older and less powerful Alnico (Al-Ni-Co) magnets. Permanent magnets will experience torque and/or displacement in the MRI field. The danger associated with magnets, as with all ferromagnetic materials, depends on how well they are affixed to the surrounding tissues.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dangerous-metals.html"}

The most important factor for establishing a suitable EKG signal for gating is good contact between the skin and electrodes. This may require shaving body hair and gently abrading the skin with a special prepping gel. MRI compatible disposable electrodes are highly recommended. Wet or sweaty skin may be blotted with a gauze pad. Do not use alcohol as it will excessively dry the skin and prevent good electrical contact. Do not reposition or reuse electrodes once placed. It is essential the patient remain cool during the entire MRI procedure so that sweating doesn't build up under the electrodes as the study progresses. Wearing loose-fitting clothing and maintaining air flow during the scan may help. Positioning of the electrodes is important, and for RF-safety generally a rather close configuration is advised. Investing time up front in obtaining a strong and reliable EKG tracing is well worth the effort. Some patients with congenital malformations of the heart or left ventricular infarction may need to have leads placed in otherwise unusual locations to detect an acceptable signal. Once the patient is placed into the center of the scanner, the EKG will change due to magnetohydrodynamic effects that tend to elevate the T-wave and depress the R-wave. Several options are available at the scanner console for selecting the best EKG lead or combination of leads for triggering. Generally the lead with the highest and sharpest R-waves is chosen. Some scanners offer the option of detection using a vectorcardiographic method rather than simple EKG which increases reliability of triggering. Occasionally EKG-triggering will simply be impossible leaving peripheral pulse gating as the only alternative. This most commonly occurs in patients with large pericardial effusions and/or emphysema where recorded EKG voltages are very small. The references below from Philips NetForum On-line Community provide additional practical tips for achieving a high success rate for EKG gating.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ekg-problems.html"}

Long before the discovery of NMR, Albert Einstein developed a quantum mechanical description of the emission of energy from atomic systems. Since NMR relaxation ultimately involves a release of energy from the spin system, the Einstein formulation applies equally well to NMR. According to Einstein's analysis, emission of energy from an atomic system may be either spontaneous or induced (stimulated) . Spontaneous emission of energy is a radiative process involving the release of a photon and typified by phenomena such as fluorescence and phosphorescence. Einstein showed that the probability of spontaneous emission is strongly frequency-dependent (proportional to f ). In the visible region of the spectrum, f  10 Hz, and spontaneous emission is a dominant process. In the radiofrequency range where NMR energies are found, however, f  100 MHz, and so spontaneous emission becomes extremely improbable. Here is another way to think about this concept: The energy gap between the spin-up and spin-down states in NMR is really quite small by atomic emission standards  at 1.5T it is only about 2 x 10 7 eV (electron-volts). By comparison, visible light photons have energies of about 2 eV, or 10 million times higher. There is thus a considerable \"advantage\" for a high-energy light photon to be emitted by phosphorescence, but relatively little \"motivation\" for an already low energy nuclear spin to switch states spontaneously. (Based on drawing by glitterweazl at drawception.com) Most energy emission in NMR must be induced through a direct interaction of a nucleus with its external environment. This interaction may be through the electrical or magnetic fields generated by other nuclei, electrons, or molecules, or result from interaction with the with the RF coil and field.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/release-of-rf-energy.html"}

In 2DFT imaging, considerable disparity exists between sampling times for data collection in the frequency- and phase-encode directions. In the frequency-encode direction, all 256-512 samples of a signal are acquired in the space of a single echo (e.g., over 5-80 msec). Conversely, the time to obtain a single sample in the phase-encode direction is on the order of seconds to minutes, since essentially all lines of k -space must be collected to obtain the complete data set for Fourier reconstruction. Most gross physiologic motions (respiration, swallowing, cardiac pulsation) occur over time frames of a hundred milliseconds to several seconds. Because these motions are slow in relation to the frequency-encode sampling interval, they typically produce only a small amount of spatial blurring locally in the frequency-encode direction. Conversely, since the phase sampling interval is generally equal or longer than the period of most physiologic motions, artifacts will be more prominent in this direction. Furthermore, these artifacts will be propagated in the phase-encode direction regardless of whether the physiologic motion has occurred in the frequency-encode, phase-encode, or slice-select directions. A simple and useful imaging strategy for all types of motion is simply to swap the phase- and frequency-encoding axes. Although this will not change the motion artifact, it will simply shift it into a different direction so that it will not spill over areas of interest. For example, in axial cranial imaging the PE direction is usually selected to be left-to-right so that orbital motion artifacts do not spill over onto the brain. Left-to-right phase-encoding direction has been chosen for this axial head study so that orbital motion artifacts do not spill over onto the brain.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/motion-artifact-direction.html"}

The chemical structures of water and fat are unique, so we would naturally expect their magnetic properties to differ. Water, of course, is a small, rapidly rotating molecule, with a polar character due to its electronegative oxygen atom. Fat, on the other hand, exists in tissues primarily as long chain triglycerides. These are bulky molecules that move slowly, and most of their hydrogen atoms are nestled in aliphatic side chains among relatively electroneutral carbon atoms. Triglyceride molecule. The main component of adipose tissue. Rotates slowly due to its large size at a rate for efficient T1 relaxation (i.e., has a short T1). The H atoms are nestled within long carbon chains, shielded by electron clouds and protected from the full force of the externally applied magnetic field. Water molecule. Spins rapidly and is inefficient at T1 relaxation (i.e., has a long T1). The electronegative O atom pulls protective electron clouds away from the H nuclei, exposing them to the full force of the external magnetic field; hence they resonate faster than many other H's. These molecular structures give rise to two key differences in the magnetic properties of water and fat: The T1 values for fat are much shorter than those of water The hydrogen protons of water resonate slightly faster than those of fat. This difference in resonance frequency is known as the water-fat chemical shift . In most of the human body water and fat molecules reside in separate anatomic compartments and can be allowed to pleasantly coexist in the MR image. Sometimes, however, we may wish to suppress the signal from fat because it interferes with the detection of pathology or contrast enhancement. In a small minority of cases we may actually wish to suppress the signal from water to allow fat to be characterized or quantified. A large number of methods have been developed to suppress, augment, or separate water and fat signals for MR imaging and spectroscopy. These techniques accomplish their goal by exploiting differences in T1, resonant frequency, or both.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fat--water-properties.html"}

In the preceding Q&A , T2 was defined as a time constant for the decay of transverse magnetization arising from natural interactions at the atomic or molecular levels. used as a measurement of those processes contributing to the transverse decay of the MR signal that arise from natural interactions at the atomic and molecular levels within the tissue or substance of interest. In any real NMR experiment, however, the transverse magnetization decays much faster than would be predicted by natural atomic and molecular mechanisms; this rate is denoted T2* (\"T2-star\") . T2* can be considered an \"observed\" or \"effective\" T2, whereas the first T2 can be considered the \"natural\" or \"true\" T2 of the tissue being imaged. T2* is always less than or equal to T2. T2* results principally from inhomogeneities in the main magnetic field. These inhomogeneities may be the result of intrinsic defects in the magnet itself or from susceptibility-induced field distortions produced by the tissue or other materials placed within the field. Certain MR sequences using gradient echoes and relatively long TE values are called T2*-weighted. They are used to accentuate local magnetic homogeneity effects to aid in the detection of hemorrhage or calcifications. T2*-sensitive sequences also form the basis for functional MRI (fMRI) using the BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) technique. T2* image showing low signal area due to old blood products.

The gradient is: Note we have calculated only the magnitude of the gradient. But like the main magnetic field, the gradient ( G ) is a vector , possessing both magnitude and direction . By convention, the direction of the main magnetic field is designated to be the z -axis. For completeness, therefore, we should say the gradient ( G ) is a vector of magnitude 2 mT/meter in the z-direction. Alternatively, we could write G = G z = 2 mT/meter.

All the contrast-enhanced MRA techniques discussed up to now obtain images at a single point in time after injection. Time-resolved MRA sequences, known under acronyms such as TRICKS and TWIST , obtain a series of images displaying passage of the contrast bolus. A typical time-resolved MRA study might contain 20+ images obtained at rates as rapid as 1-2 frames per second. An inherent trade-off exists between spatial and temporal resolution. The center of k -space contains information about basic image contrast, while edges and details are encoded in the k -space periphery. Increasing spatial resolution thus requires that more k -space points be sampled. However, sampling more points requires additional imaging time, adversely impacting temporal resolution. TRICKS Head MRA/MRV TWIST CE-MRA of lower extremities Time-resolved MRA techniques balance these competing resolution requirements through a process known as view-sharing . Although the details of these methods vary, all begin by acquiring a non-contrast, full-resolution image of the area of interest. During passage of the contrast bolus, the center of k -space is sampled much more frequently than the periphery, which is updated only periodically. The data from the different partial k -space samplings are combined to create a series of time-resolved images with satisfactory spatial resolution. The original non-contrast image can be used as a mask for subtraction to improve vascular conspicuity. Time-resolved CE-MRA methods all trace their origins to a method known as keyhole imaging , described in a prior Q&A . Keyhole imaging was developed in the 1990's and used primarily for performing dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging of tumors and vascular lesions. Using a rectangular (Cartesian) k -space grid, the central phase-encoding lines were repeatedly sampled after contrast injection with only occasional sampling of the peripheral lines. View-sharing was used to produce a set of full-resolution images from the data sets. Modern time-resolved MRA techniques typically use radial sampling schemes, acquiring 3D k -space in round or oval \"cylinders\". Several vendor-specific implementations are compared below. GE uses the acronym TRICKS (\"Time-Resolved Imaging of Contrast KineticS\"); Siemens uses TWIST (\" Time-resolved angiography With Stochastic Trajectories\"), Philips calls theirs 4D-TRAK (\"4D Time-Resolved Angiography using Keyhole\"), Hitachi uses TRAQ (\"Time-Resolved AcQuisition\") and Toshiba Freeze Frame . Philips' 4D-TRAK is a centric version of the classic keyhole method, where k-space is divided into a central and peripheral oval regions. Sampling of the central region is acquired much more frequently than the periphery. Siemens' TWIST also divides k -space into two regions, but samples them alternately using a semi-randomized method. The peripheral region is sparsely sampled at each time point, although is eventually covered over several cycles. GE's TRICKS divides k -space into four concentric regions ( A -D), sampling them in the order -- A - B - A - C - A -D -- A - B - A - C - A -D -- All time-resolved MRA methods have at their core a 3D-spoiled GRE sequence with thin slices, very short TRs and TEs , low flip angles, use of both read- and phase-conjugate symmetry, parallel imaging acquisition, and zero-interpolation filling in the slice direction. Specific k -space imaging parameters must also be selected. These vary by vendor and may include the size of the central k -space region (typically 15-30%), the undersampling fraction of the outer region (typically 20-30%), central k -space refresh rate (in frames per second), and total number of frames to be acquired (depends on anticipated circulation time). Although used for dynamic perfusion imaging instead of for MRA, GE's sequence DISCO (DIfferential Subsampling with Cartesian Ordering) shares similar features with TRICKS and TWIST. DISCO subdivides k -space into several annular elliptical regions that are randomly and incompletely sampled together with a central region that is consistently sampled. DISCO is incorporated into a 3D spoiled-GRE core sequence with dual in phase-out of phase echoes allowing separation of fat and water signals. At present, DISCO is primarily used for dynamic contrast-enhanced studies of the breast, liver, and prostate. TWIST MRA showing retrograde flow and collaterals Time-resolved MRA sequences are widely used wherever circulation is rapid (carotids, cardio-pulmonary system) or unpredictable (extremities). The method is particularly useful for evaluating collateral or retrograde flow around stenoses and in the work up of arteriovenous malformations. Accurate timing of bolus arrival is not required; the technologist simply starts the sequence and runs it until the contrast has passed through the vascular system. Much smaller doses of contrast can also be used than with conventional CE-MRA. Fluoroscopic triggering methods used in conventional CE-MRA are low-resolution, 2D versions of these time-resolved sequences.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/tricks-or-twist.html"}

When a patient is placed in the magnetic field of an MR scanner, an elevation of the T-wave of the EKG is frequently noted. This elevation may be so marked that the T-wave actually becomes larger than the QRS-complex.The R-wave may also be reduced in amplitude and is occasionally inverted. These effects on the T- and R-waves may result in faulty cardiac triggering, especially at higher fields. EKG in various magnetic fields This magnetic field effect on the EKG does not originate in the heart itself, but represents a superimposed voltage within blood in the descending thoracic aorta which has been induced by its flow in the magnetic field. The induction of a voltage in a conductive fluid flowing through a magnetic field is a well known phenomenon in fluid mechanics called the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect . The MHD effect, in fact, is precisely the same principle by which electromagnetic blood flow meters operate. In humans imaged at 1.5 T, the MHD-induced voltage is on the order of 5-10 mV and is even larger at 3.0T and above. The reason this voltage is superimposed on the T-wave is that this is the time of maximum flow in the descending aorta. The MHD-induced voltage distorts the recorded EKG but produces no untoward effects on the heart or blood flow. Its only potential clinical significance is that it may cause ST-segment elevation or depression and thus mimic or mask cardiac ischemia occurring during the MRI examination.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/magnet-changes-ekg.html"}

MR Unsafe tympanostomy tubes Only a tiny fraction of tympanostomy tubes are deemed MR Unsafe , specifically a group of four devices made by Kurz Medical (Dusslingen, Germany). Three of these are \"Tuebingen-type\" collar-button-style tubes with a ferromagnetic stainless steel wire (the latter component making the device unsafe ). The fourth is the so-called \"Minimal-type\" composed of gold-plated ferromagnetic stainless steel and intended for short-term use . Ossicular Implants The middle ear contains three bony ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes) that mechanically transmit vibrations of the eardrum to the inner ear where sensorineural hearing occurs. A number of implants are available to replace individual ossicles (such as those affected by congenital anomaly, infection, or trauma). Some prostheses supplant two or more ossicles simultaneously: the PORP (Partial Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis) replacing the malleus and incus (but not the stapes); and the TORP (Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis) that replacing all three. Ossicular implants are made of various materials, including \"MR Safe\" non-metals (fluoroplastic and hydroxyapatite) and MR Conditional metals (titanium, Nitinol, nonferromagnetic stainless steel, and platinum).

The transducer can be attached to an ossicle/PORP/TORP or placed in the round window niche. Both the original version of the Soundbridge and its successor (Model 502) are considered MR Unsafe . (Clinical MR testing of the 502 model, initially thought to be safe from in vitro studies, resulted in discomfort and dislocation of the transducer in several patients).

As you might imagine, multiple configurations of artificial neurons are possible. Some of the more important neural network variations are briefly cataloged below. The first type, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , will only be briefly introduced here, but is so important for image-based applications that it will be covered more extensively in several subsequent Q&As. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) CNN is the configuration most widely used for MRI and other image processing applications. Data is typically input as 2D or 3D arrays of pixels and initial computational phases are restricted to operations on neighboring pixels. Convolution involves a sliding multiplication and addition of regional data points by a small (~5x5) array of numbers called a kernel or filter . By using sets of different kernels (such as ones that emphasize edges or shapes) a set of regional feature maps is produced. The next step, called subsampling or pooling , shrinks the size of each feature map, typically taking the maximum value in each 2x2 pixel group. The convolution-pooling process may be repeated several times, producing ever smaller \"feature of feature\" maps. In the final stage, known as vectorization or flattening , all the resultant 2-dimensional arrays are converted into a single long chain of numbers (i.e., a \"vector\"). The vectorized feature maps then serve as inputs into a fully connected neural network whose output may then be fed back in training to adjust weighting parameters in the convolutional part of the network or used to produce a final result (such as tissue segmentation or classification). Building blocks of a CNN Two basic two types of CNN architectures can be distinguished based on the connection modes between convolutional layers. The first type of CNN architecture (pictured above) connects different convolutional layers in series. Examples include such well-known configurations as AlexNet, VGGNet, and ZFNet . The second architecture connects convolutions in parallel , characterized by the inception modules used by GoogleNet and its progeny. An inception module consists of multiple parallel convolutional layers, each with a different filter size. The intuition behind this design is that different filter sizes are better suited for detecting features of different scales, which is useful for recognizing objects of various sizes and shapes. Encoder-Decoder Networks Encoder-decoder networks are a specific form of CNN widely used for image segmentation, co-registration, and artifact reduction. They typically have a \"U-configuration\", with an initial contracting path (the encoder ) followed by an expansion path (the decoder ). Full dimensional images input into the encoder portion are reduced in size via a CNN-type mechanism into lower dimensional data, thus compressing the feature maps. These maps are then re-expanded in the decoder portion back to full size containing the most meaningful features. Loss of spatial resolution can be overcome by inserting skip connections between the sides to pass through important details to the output image. The U-net network (pictured below) and its variants are the most widely used encoder-decoder networks for medical imaging. Basic U-net architecture. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) GANs consist of two competing components: (1) t he Generator, a deconvolutional network that uses random noise and interpolation to generate \"fake\" but realistic-looking images, and (2) the Discriminator , a conventional CNN previously trained with supervised learning to identify real images at a certain level of accuracy. In operation, images are randomly sent to the discriminator, which must then decide which are real and which have been generated. If its judgment is wrong (i.e. a fake image being mistaken for real), the Discriminator will learn from its error and improve on subsequent runs. If its judgment is correct, this information will be sent back to the Generator to help it develop better \"fake\" images. Through iteration, the performance of both components improve, as does the GAN as a whole. Applications in MRI include image synthesis, reconstruction, segmentation, co-registration, and production of \"super-resolution\" images. Structure of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), where the Generator tries to fool the Discriminator between identifying \"real\" and \"fake\" images, with both learning iteratively through the process. Nodes in an RNN can feed recent outputs back onto themselves or others Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) RNNs differ from standard \"feed forward\" neural networks in that they contain data feedback loops. This feedback serves as a type of \"memory\" allowing them to use recent outputs as updated inputs for subsequent calculations. RNNs are useful in the analysis of sequentially acquired data, including time series and speech processing. For example, the location of the cardiac septum on cine MRI depends on its immediately prior position; the next word in a radiology report depends on the previous word. Simple feedback loops can only allow a handful of data time steps to be retained and used. To overcome this limitation more complex RNN configurations, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) , have been developed that allow retention of data over many thousands of time points. Bi-directional RNNs are also possible, where the output of later nodes is fed back to update past nodes in an iterative fashion. In recent years, Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs) discussed below have largely replaced RNNs and LSTMs for many applications. Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs) TNNs , also known simply as Transformers , were developed in 2017 by the Google Brain research group to improve natural language processing. The wildly popular application, ChatGPT , is based on a transformer architecture. (The letters GPT stand for \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer\".) Many transformer variations exist, including hybrid forms with CNNs or GANs. Transformer networks are different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in that they do not use sequential processing or convolutional filters. Instead, they use self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing to handle input sequences. Typical Transformer architecture with encoder on left and decoder on right. (From He et al under CC-BY) The typical Transformer architecture utilizes an Encoder-Decoder arrangement as shown in the diagram right. Transformers are designed to process data in parallel rather than sequentially, so that information is simultaneously passed between the Encoder and Decoder segments. This parallel architecture means that graphics processing units (GPUs) can be used more efficiently increasing the speed of calculations and training. Two other characteristic features of Transformer Networks are the use of positional encoding and self-attention. Positional encoding refers to the indexing of words or image segments by original location as they pass through the network. Self-attention refers to the ability of the network to identify the most important features in a data set and their relationships to other data. A complete description of Transformers is well beyond the scope of this web site, but I suspect you will here more and more about these networks for image-based applications in the future. Due to the large number of pixels, images are usually broken up into multiple small \"patches\" (say, 16x16 in size) whose relative locations (positional encodings) are remembered by the system and key features identified (by self-attention mechanisms). Some recent examples of the use of Transformers in medical imaging applications (including segmentation, classification, and processing) are provided in the references below.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/deep-network-types.html"}

Superconductivity is an unusual property of certain metals, alloys, and ceramics in which electrical resistance drops to zero when the temperature is reduced below a critical value ( Tc ), also known as the transition temperature . In other materials electrical resistance decreases as the temperature is lowered but does not disappear completely. But for superconductors the resistance is truly zero. Electrical resistance primarily arises because free electrons moving through a material are scattered due to interactions with the lattice due to thermal vibrations. So, as in the graph above, all materials show a gradual decrease in electrical resistance with decreasing temperature. In superconductors below T c , however, these scattering mechanisms are no longer effective and the electrons pass unimpeded through the material. Diagram illustrating the action of a Cooper's pair of electrons passing though a positively charged metallic lattice. The first electron distorts the lattice bringing the positive charges closer together, making it easier for the second electron to pass through. An analogy to one race car \"drafting\" behind another is sometimes made. The physical basis for this complete loss of electrical resistance is poorly understood. One of the earliest and most widely accepted explanations is known as the BCS theory (honoring the men who constructed it in the 1950's -- Bardeen, Cooper, and Schreiffer). A key component of this model is the dissociation of electrical current from individual electrons to pairs of electrons (\" Cooper's pairs \"). These electron pairs are in turn linked to all other conduction electrons in the material by a single coherent quantum mechanical wave function that determines the behavior of all the superconducting electrons. A second feature of superconductivity reasonably explained by BCS Theory is the Meissner effect - the complete expulsion of all magnetic fields from the interior of the superconductor. This creates a state of \"perfect\" diamagnetism, with susceptibility (  ) = 1, illustrated in the accompanying video. Superconducting diamagnetism arises from persistent \"screening currents\" that flow to oppose the applied field. It is therefore fundamentally different from the diamagnetism of \"regular\" materials that results principally from electron orbital angular momentum. Approximately half of the known pure elements demonstrate low temperature superconductivity. For industrial use, however, the most important superconductors are multi-element alloys or ceramics. Superconducting windings for most human MR scanners are made from Nb-Ti; ultra-high-field animal scanners and NMR spectrometers typically use Nb 3 Sn; MgB 2 is a promising new alloy for lower field instruments.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/superconductivity.html"}

Scan of a homogeneous phantom, windowed to bring out intensity differences Measurement of image uniformity is performed using a homogenous oil or ion-doped water phantom. The American College of Radiology (ACR) method is the simplest, in which the image is first windowed to bring out subtle intensity differences. The maximum ( max ) and minimum ( min ) intensity values are then measured for small (~ 1 cm), and a Percent Image Uniformity (PIU) is calculated as PIU = { 1  ( max  min ) / ( max + min ) } x 100% where 100% indicates perfect uniformity. I have always been surprised to find that even with the use of image intensity correction filters (such as PURE, SCIC, CLEAR, etc) typical PIU values on a properly calibrated modern 3.0T scanner may only be slightly above 85%. This means that when scanning a homogeneous phantom up to a 15% variation in pixel values across the image may normally be present. (This is in stark contrast to CT scanning, where very little variation in region-of-interest (ROI) values across a uniform phantom is seen). So be careful when you measure ROI differences in an MR image in a clinical setting; you may just be measuring non-uniformity! Image uniformity problems can result from: 1) lack of centering -- i.e. the patient or phantom is too close to one side of the coil; 2) ghosting from motion or eddy currents; or 3) failure of coil components including decoupling circuitry.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/image-uniformity.html"}

GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition) and ARC (Autocalibrating Reconstruction for Cartesian imaging) are multi-coil parallel imaging (PI) techniques. Like other PI methods (e.g. SENSE/ASSET), GRAPPA/ARC sample only a limited number of phase-encoding steps. Phase undersampling dramatically reduces imaging time but results in overlapping/aliased signals that must be untangled. In SENSE/ASSET coil sensitivities are used to sort out these signals in the image domain after Fourier transformation. In GRAPPA/ARC the correction is made in k -space before Fourier transformation. It is sometimes said that: SENSE/ASSET methods reconstruct, then correct. GRAPPA/ARC methods correct, then reconstruct. The diagram below illustrates the four major steps in the GRAPPA/ARC process. 1. Data Acquisition . The acquired MR signals are digitized, demodulated, and used to fill the k -space matrix for each coil. Because multiple phase-encoding steps have been skipped, many k -space lines will be missing. Lines through the center of k-space, however, are fully sampled and constitute the autocalibration signal (ACS) region. These extra ACS lines are interspersed with image acquisition itself (hence the term, \"autocalibrating\"). 2. Estimation of Missing Lines. Known data from the ACS are used to calculate weighting factors for each coil. These weighting factors reflect how each coil distorts, smears, and displaces spatial frequencies within the full FOV k -space data. Missing k -space points are estimated in an iterative fashion using these global weighting factors combined with local known data for each small region (known a block or kernel ). It should be noted that w eighting factors and known data from all coils are used to estimate missing data for each coil. 3. Generate Individual Coil Images. With the missing lines of k -space now filled, Fourier transformation is performed to create individual images from each coil. Unlike the coil images in SENSE/ASSET, these GRAPPA/ARC images are free from aliasing. 4. Combine. The individual coil images are at last combined using a sum of squares method into the final magnitude image. Overview of the GRAPPA/ARC reconstruction process. Note PE along horizontal axis. The critical step in GRAPPA/ARC involves estimation of the missing points. Many variations are possible, including the size of the reconstruction kernel and number of parameters used. The major difference between GRAPPA and ARC is that the latter uses a 3D kernel to synthesize missing data taking into account neighboring source data from all three directions. A somewhat different estimation process is also employed in ARC to make the 3D data computations manageable. Estimation of missing k -space data in GRAPPA/ARC.

The chronic phase of a hematoma is arbitrarily defined to begin at about 2 months after the initial hemorrhage. By this time the original blood-containing cavity has largely collapsed, surrounding reactive edema has disappeared, RBCs have completely lysed, hemoglobin species have undergone degradation, and heme iron has been released and deposited in the surrounding tissues. The center and periphery of chronic hematomas have different pathological and imaging characteristics and must therefore be considered separately. Chronic Hematoma Center Chronic (old) hematoma in left basal ganglia has collapsed into a residual slit. The residual central cavity of a chronic intracranial hematoma is filled with dark brown liquid and/or gelatinous material consisting primarily of water, with some dissolved proteins, fibrin, and hemoglobin degradation products. Some paramagnetic methemoglobin may still remain, but by 2 months most has been converted to hemichromes or even smaller protein fragments. Hemichromes, described in more detail in the next Q&A , are oxidatively denatured forms of met-Hb that cannot bind oxygen and have lost all paramagnetic properties. Very old hematomas may be slit-like without any internal structure and contain only clear or straw-colored fluid. The imaging characteristics of the center of a chronic hematoma reflects its high water content. As such this region is typically hyperintense to brain on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images. Occasionally the center of older hematomas (especially subdurals) will remain bright for several months on T1-weighted images. This is most likely due to residual methemoglobin with possible contributions from soluble ferrous salts. Diffusion characteristics also reflect high free water content, with only minimally restricted diffusion noted that depends on the protein content of the fluid. Thus the center of old hematomas will be dark on DWI/Trace images and bright on ADC maps. Chronic Hematoma Periphery Around the periphery of older hematoma cavities, iron atoms released from degraded hemoglobin coalesce by the thousands into large, chunky metalloprotein complexes known as ferritin and hemosiderin . Ferritin and hemosiderin are engulfed by invading macrophages and ultimately deposit along the walls of old hematoma cavities. Outside the central nervous system they are also scavenged by reticulo-endothelial system (RES) cells of liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Ferritin and hemosiderin are superparamagnetic, with creating large microscopic susceptibility gradients in the areas where they accumulate. As water molecules diffuse through these gradients their resonance frequencies change with resultant T2/T2* dephasing. The iron centers of ferritin and hemosiderin are sequestered and do not allow close approach of water for inner sphere relaxation. Hence only a minimal amount of T1 shortening occurs. Water molecules experience a changing local magnetic field and dephase as they diffuse past a chunk of superparamagnetic ferritin or hemosiderin The imaging characteristics of chronic hematomas are described in the table below, followed by a clinical example.

{"id": "e27e82b4-3a97-437e-b238-e43ecc4e7b36", "contents": "T2 Relaxation: Definition What is T2 relaxation? T2 relaxation is the process by which the transverse components of magnetization ( M xy ) decay or dephase. As originally described by Felix Bloch (1946), T2 relaxation is considered to follow first order kinetics, resulting in a simple exponential decay (like a radio-isotope) with time constant T2. Thus T2 is the time required for the transverse magnetization to fall to approximately 37% (1/e) of its initial value. Synonyms for T2 relaxation are transverse relaxation and spin-spin relaxation. (I discourage using the second synonym because \"spin-spin\" interactions are just one of several mechanisms by which T2 relaxation can occur.) Diagram showing loss of M xy component of magnetization and T2. This diagram, like most others, is misleading in that only a tiny fraction of spins ever have transverse phase coherence. Recall from a previous Q&A that tipping the net magnetization ( M ) into the transverse plane does not cause all the spins to magically lock in phase. What happens is that those same spins initially showing some statistical \"preference\" for the z -direction prior to the RF-pulse have now been rotated into the transverse plane. The initial Boltzmann distribution \"ordering\" of spins in the z -direction has been has been preserved and transformed by the rotation into what can be considered \"phase coherence\" in the xy -plane. Simultaneously, the initial value of M in the z -direction ( M z ) immediately before the RF-pulse has been converted to a net transverse magnetization ( M xy ) after the pulse. The diagrams below, although still not perfect, are perhaps a little closer to what really happens. The spin system begins with an slightly unequal distribution of angular momentum in the z-direction, creating a net magnetization ( M ). The 90-pulse rotates the entire system converting the initial asymmetry of z-components into asymmetry of transverse (xy)-components resulting in a temporary statistical \"phase coherence\". After the 90-pulse there is an asymmetric statistical clustering of spins in the transverse plane which constitutes \"phase coherence\". Only a tiny fraction (~10 -6 ) of spins contribute to this phenomenon. The number of these spins has been grossly and disproportionately exaggerated in the diagram. Now tipped into the xy -plane and the RF-pulse over, the transverse spin components (represented by small black arrows in the drawing above) and their vector sum ( M xy ) will precess within the plane at the Larmor frequency. It is the sweep of this transverse magnetization ( M xy ) that induces a current in the receiver coils and is solely responsible for generating the MR signal. The presence of a non-zero net transverse magnetization ( M xy ) is at any time is evidence of persistent asymmetry of transverse components of angular momentum, and what is commonly called \"phase coherence.\" Any process that disrupts either the number or relative positions of these transverse components will result in T2 relaxation. These fall into one of two general categories: Loss of spin from T1 interaction T2 Relaxation Accompanying T1 Relaxation As described in the prior Q&A , T1 relaxation occurs when a spin exchanges energy with its external environment. If such an energy exchange were to affect one of the spins contributing to M xy , both the transverse and longitudinal components of its angular momentum would be randomly changed and it would immediately lose phase relations with other spins. You can think of its arrow as simply \"dropping out\" of the diagram. Without that spin's small contribution, the value of M xy would be diminished and so T2 relaxation would have occurred. Thus, any process causing T1 relaxation also results in T2 relaxation . This is sometimes called the \"T1 contribution to T2\" or \"T1 in T2\". Phase change (  ) of a spin due to a local field T2 Relaxation Occurring Without T1 Relaxation Although T2 relaxation always accompanies T1 relaxation, T2 relaxation may also occur without T1 relaxation . This is sometimes referred to as the \"secular contribution to T2.\" One of the most common ways for this to occur is for a spin to be located in a molecular environment where it experiences a local static field disturbance ( B loc ) in addition to the main magnetic field ( B o ). For example, the spin might be located on a water molecule diffusing by an iron-containing clump of hemosiderin or reside on a molecule next to an electronegative oxygen atom. If B loc is in the same ( z -) direction as B o , the two static fields add together and a spin within that altered local environment would now precess at frequency  ( B o + B loc ). Meanwhile, the other unaffected spins would still be precessing at the original Larmor frequency ( f o = B o ). Over time ( t ) a phase difference of  = B loc  t would develop between the spin and its colleagues. With this spin now out of step with the others, the net transverse magnetization ( M xy ) would be diminished. In other words, T2 relaxation would have occurred. T2 relaxation without T1 relaxation can also happen in a special form of dipolar interaction known informally as a spin-spin \" flip-flop \". In this mechanism a pair of spins simultaneously exchange their longitudinal angular momentum components resulting in no net T1 effect but loss of T2 coherence. Spin-spin \"flip-flop\". A pair of spins exchanges longitudinal angular momentum going from state {up|down} to state {down|up}. There is no change in T1 but the interaction produces T2 relaxation. The basic concepts of T2 relaxation are summarized below. T2 Relaxation Summary  T2 is the time constant for decay/dephasing of transverse magnetization ( M xy )  Synonyms: Transverse relaxation, spin-spin relaxation  May occur with or without energy transfer  Anything causing T1 relaxation also causes T2 relaxation, but T2 relaxation can occur without T1 relaxation.  Major causes of T2-only relaxation include dephasing by static local field disturbances and flip-flop exchanges between spins", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-t2.html"}

Inversion recovery (IR) is a conventional spin echo (SE) sequence preceded by a 180 inverting pulse. In other words, if a SE sequence is denoted by {90180echo}, the IR sequence can be written 180  {90180echo} The time between the 180 inverting pulse and the 90-pulse is called the inversion time (TI) . The repetition time ( TR ) and echo time ( TE ) are defined as they are for spin echo. Comparison of Spin Echo (SE) and Inversion Recovery (IR). The IR sequence is simply a SE sequence preceded at time TI by a 180 inverting pulse. Regrowth of tissue M z after 180 pulse. The function of the inverting pulse is to flip the initial longitudinal magnetization ( M o ) of all tissues in the imaged slice or volume to point opposite to the direction of the main magnetic field ( B o ). During the TI interval, these inverted tissues undergo T1 relaxation as they variably seek to re-establish magnetization along the + z- direction. When spin echo signal generation begins (at the 90-pulse), the initial longitudinal magnetizations of different tissues are now separated based on their different intrinsic T1 relaxation times. The degree of separation (and hence image contrast) is controlled by varying the TI parameter in the pulse sequence. Additional contrast effects are also obtained by manipulation of TR and TE . In addition to the timing parameters ( TR / TI / TE ), how the MR signal is reconstructed has a significant effect on image contrast and appearance. The two reconstruction methods used for IR are magnitude reconstruction and phase-corrected reconstruction , the subject of a separate Q&A . Historically, IR techniques were widely used in the \"early days\" of MRI (c. 1980-1985). They produced excellent image contrast, especially for T1-weighted imaging, but were time-consuming (15-20 minute sequences typical). After about 1985 spin-echo techniques largely supplanted IR for most applications. In the late 1990's use of the fast spin echo (FSE) signal generation allowed high quality IR-FSE sequences to be performed in a more reasonable time frame (5-10 min). Today, IR techniques are widely used in all branches of MRI, but especially for neuroradiology and cardiac imaging applications.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-ir.html"}

Time-of-flight ( TOF ) effects refer to signal variations resulting from the motion of protons flowing into or out of an imaging volume during a given pulse sequence. In both spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging, inflow of spins results in increased signal; this phenomenon is known as flow-related enhancement . Conversely, outflow of spins may result in decreased signal intensity, a phenomenon known as high-velocity signal loss , also called \"washout\" . TOF effects in the jugular vein and carotid artery. Both TOF effects are demonstrated in the image above. The more slowly flowing blood in the jugular vein (blue arrow) demonstrates flow-related enhancement. The more rapidly flowing blood in the carotid artery (red arrow) has low signal due to flow-related signal loss (washout). Flow-Related Enhancement . Flow-related enhancement is a consequence of magnetic saturation , a phenomenon described more completely in a prior Q&A and illustrated in the diagram below. Tissues contained within an imaging volume are subjected to a continuous train of radiofrequency (RF) pulses. These RF pulses repeatedly flip the longitudinal tissue magnetization ( M z ) into the transverse plane. If the pulses are widely spaced ( TR > 5 x T1), complete recovery occurs and no saturation effect is observed. Partial saturation and development of steady-state magnetization (M ss ) [left] TR >> T1 so there is complete recovery of M z back to M o before the 2nd RF-pulse. [right] TR is shorter and M z does not fully recover before next RF-pulse is applied. After a few pulses a new steady-state longitudinal magnetization ( M ss ) is reached, with M ss < M o . Most sequences, however, utilize shorter TR values, and hence the next RF-pulse is applied before M z has fully recovered. The longitudinal magnetization evolves to a new lower steady state ( M ss ). The tissues within the imaged volume are said to be partially saturated, as their MR signals are lower than they would otherwise be. \"Fresh\" blood flowing into the imaged slab has not been subjected to these RF-pulses and is therefore fully magnetized (unsaturated). When a bolus of this fresh blood enters a slice and is subjected to its first set of RF-pulses, its signal is significantly stronger than that of the tissues (and other blood) within the slab. This is the genesis of flow-related enhancement. Flow-related enhancement of arteries at skull base on lowest slices of head MRI. Veins are not enhanced as they are flowing the opposite direction Penetration of flow-related enhancement several slices deep into the imaged volume. The faster flows at the center of the vessel may persist giving a \"target\" appearance. Flow-related enhancement is typically seen at the end slices of a multi-slice acquisition where the fresh blood is entering. If blood flow is sufficiently rapid, this effect may penetrate several slices deep into the slab. Sometimes only a central bright dot will be seen in the vessel at the deeper slices corresponding to the fastest flow in the center of the vessel. High-velocity signal loss. High-velocity signal loss, also known as \"washout\", is a time-of-flight effect that results in decreased intravascular signal. This phenomenon occurs especially in spin-echo imaging and is typically seen in arteries and larger veins that are flowing perpendicular plane of imaging. Unlike flow-related enhancement, high-velocity signal loss can occur anywhere in the imaging slab and is not confined to the end slices. High velocity signal loss in both the femoral artery (red arrow) and vein (blue arrow) High-velocity signal loss occurs when spins flow out of slice before they are stimulated by both 90 and 180 pulses. It is therefore most prominent on long TE spin-echo images, since long echo times provide a greater opportunity for spins to flow out of the slice between the 90 and 180 pulses.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/time-of-flight-effects.html"}

In MRI we often focus on the magnetic properties of tissues (such as magnetic saturation and susceptibility), but two important tissue electrical properties should also be considered: Electrical conductivity (  ) : the ability of a material to transport charges, or equivalently, to carry an electric current . Electrical permittivity (  ) : the ability of a material to rotate molecular dipoles and trap/store charge; hence the degree to which a material becomes polarized when placed in an electric field. Electrical currents in tissues are primarily due to the movement of Na+ ions, so conductivity () reflects Na+ concentration, which may increase locally in tumors and ischemic states (where Na-K pump mechanisms may be damaged). Permittivity () is also increased in certain tumors, being closely related to conductivity () as well as to tissue anisotropy, free water content, and surface charges on proteins. Both  and  are tissue-, temperature-, and frequency-dependent. A group of relatively new techniques, dubbed MR-Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) , now allow maps of permittivity (  ) and conductivity (  ) mapping to be performed using MRI pulse sequences. The most commonly used method is based on the generalized Helmholtz equation (a second order differential equation obtained by eliminating the electric field from the source-free first-order Maxwell equations). The standard result is where B 1 + = the circularly polarized complex transmit field in the direction of precession;  = the Larmor frequency;  = tissue magnetic permeability, assumed to be equal to  o (the permeability of free space);  = tissue electrical conductivity;  = tissue electrical permittivity = the relative tissue permittivity (  r ) times the permittivity of free space (  o ); and i = the imaginary unit. The first step in MR-EPT is to measure the magnitude | B 1 | and phase  of the complex B 1 + field, typically obtained using established B 1 -mapping techniques (described in the references). Numerical methods can then be used to calculate tissue conductivity and permittivity at each spatial location. More than a dozen such techniques have been proposed, each requiring assumptions and facing limitations at tissue boundaries. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been employed to improve resolution and signal-to-noise. Examples of conductivity and permittivity maps of a pelvic phantom and clinical images of a breast carcinoma are shown below: Maps of conductivity (  ) and relative permittivity (  r ) in a pelvic phantom.

When fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences first came into use in the 1990s, the most striking difference compared to conventional spin-echo (CSE) was \"abnormally\" bright fat seen on the FSE images. This phenomenon is pictured right. Conventional spin-echo image (left) and fast spin-echo image (right), both with TR/TE (eff) = 3000/80. Note brighter signal from scalp fat on FSE. Although several factors may contribute to the FSE \"bright fat\" phenomenon, the dominant mechanism is thought to be T2 prolongation secondary to disruption of J-coupling interactions that take normally place between adjacent fat protons. I know this statement requires some some further background and explanation, so please try to follow the discussion below! Tissue fat exists primarily in the form of long-chain triglycerides. Each triglyceride molecule contains approximately 1 dozen types of H nuclei in slightly different chemical environments. Neighboring nuclei in these long chains normally interact with each other through a distortion of their electron clouds in a process known as J-coupling . Structure of a typical triglyceride (fat) molucule J-coupling interaction between neighboring protons is a quantum-derived effect mediated through distortions of electron clouds. The strength of the J -coupling interaction is quantified by the factor J , a resonance frequency offset that for lipid protons has values in the range of 6 to 8 Hz. This small frequency shift means that various protons in the lipid will precess at slightly different frequencies. Their signals will interfere constructively and destructively in a cyclic fashion with each other. (This is similar to the more familiar water-fat chemical shift interference described in a separate Q&A, but involves only fat protons and is field independent). The first out-of-phase interference will occur at TE= 1/2J , or at approximately 60-80 ms. It should be noted that TE's of 60-80 ms are typically used to produce T2-weighed images in conventional spin-echo imaging. By choosing TE's in this range, the signal recorded from fat is actually lower due to J -coupling effects than it might have been should a shorter or longer TE have been chosen. In a sense, therefore, it might be said that fat on T2-weighted CSE imaging is abnormally dark, rather than the fat on FSE being abnormally bright. In FSE imaging the multiple 180-pulses occur at echo spacings on the order of 10 ms and break up this pattern of J -modulation dephasing, although the J-coupling offset itself is not refocused by the 180-pulses. A complete understanding of this process requires knowledge of quantum mechanics and is therefore well beyond the scope of this website. Nevertheless, this process can be understood in the sense that multiple 180-pulses, when applied at intervals shorter than 1/ J , render all J -coupled spins chemically \"equivalent.\" The resultant signal is the no longer modulated by the coupling. Hence, the fat on FSE imaging appears brighter than that seen on CSE images. .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/bright-fat.html"}

In conventional MRI, frequency differences between voxels are used for spatial encoding. This is typically accomplished by applying a frequency-encoding gradient during signal evolution and unwinding this effect using a readout gradient during data acquisition. In MR spectroscopy , however, frequency changes cannot be used for spatial encoding as this information must be used to identify chemical shifts between molecular species. Accordingly, spatial gradients are not played during signal readout in an MRS study . Because spatial encoding by frequency cannot be used for MRS, several clever alternative methods have been developed to overcome this limitation. These include double or triple phase-encoding, coil design/positioning, and selective excitation, all discussed in later Q&A's. Once a voxel has been identified and isolated by one of these MRS spatial encoding methods, a Fourier Transform (FT) of its signal is performed. The Fourier Transform decodes the frequency information contained in the time domain signal, revealing one or more spectral peaks. In the example left, the upper voxel contains only a single chemically distinct species (A), while the lower voxel contains two (B & C). The relative areas under each peak are roughly proportional to the number of NMR-active nuclei in each molecule, while the separation of the peaks represents their chemical shift difference. Although in vivo human MRS has existed only since the early 1980's, in vitro NMR spectroscopy has been performed in chemistry laboratories since the 1950's and is now quite sophisticated. The world's most powerful NMR spectrometer currently in operation is a 23.5T unit in Lyon, France at the Centre Europen de Rsonance Magntique Nuclaire (CNRS).

As a brief review, before any RF-pulses are applied, the longitudinal net magnetization ( M z ) it at maximum value ( M o ) and the transverse components of magnetization ( M xy ) are zero. Once RF-excitation begins, the longitudinal magnetization begins to fall until it reaches a steady state value M ss , which is less than M o .

To allow these steady-state magnetizations to become established, the scanner plays out several cycles of the sequence without recording a signal. Only once the system is near equilibrium does data collection begin. These are called dummy cycles , disabled , or discarded acquisitions (DDA) .

All are these metals are either weakly ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic, and thus are MR Conditional but present no danger of displacement in the magnetic field provided they are secured to bone or another stable structure. They will create local susceptibility artifacts, however, with iron-containing alloys more so than titanium-containing ones. Susceptibility artifacts may even persist after removal of an implant due to the presence of tiny metallic fragments or dust. A small number of ferromagnetic plates and screws implanted before the early 1990s may occasionally be encountered, such as the Perflex interference screw used for cruciate ligament reconstruction of the knee. Even though a rare patient might present with highly ferromagnetic legacy orthopedic hardware, no significant safety issues should be raised. As long as these implants are secured to bone they are not dangerous to the patient, although the localized artifacts produced will be substantial. Very large orthopedic implants, such as spinal rods and total joint prostheses, may create localized tissue heating secondary to radio-frequency- or gradient-switching-induced currents, as described in this related Q&A .

Since a pair of lines are like crests and peaks of adjacent waves, line pairs per mm is a measure of spatial frequency . Line-pair resolution test pattern. How good is your monitor? Just as a 1-dimensional MR signal can be decomposed into a sum of simple sine and cosine waves, a 2-dimensional image can be decomposed into a set of planar waves varying in phase, frequency, amplitude, and direction.

As planar waves from more directions are added, the image begins to emerge. All images can thus be decomposed using Fourier analysis into planar waves with various frequencies, phases, amplitudes, and orientations. This is easy to appreciate in the zebra photo, but holds true for images even without sharp boundaries. In fact, the human visual cortex contains cells that respond to sinusoidal spatial frequencies in different orientations. The k -space representation of an MR image is merely an organized collection of these spatial frequencies reflecting that image's spatial harmonic content.

The previous Q&A's about hemorrhage primarily applied to higher field ( 0.5 T) systems where imaging findings are dominated by the paramagnetic effects of hemoglobin. At fields below 0.5 T, at least two major differences are noted: The characteristic T2/T2* hypointensity of intracellular deoxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin seen at high fields is minimal or absent at low fields. Such hypointensity is due to susceptibility effects, which scale with the square of the magnetic field (B o ). In going from 1.5T down to 0.15T, therefore, susceptibility effects are reduced by a factor of 100. The centers of acute and subacute hematomas are recognizable only by their shapes and a halo of surrounding edema, with signal intensities close to that of normal brain. The example below compares a hematoma imaged at 1.5T with two images obtained at 0.064T. Acute hematoma imaged by T2-FLAIR at 1.5 T (left), showing markedly low central signal due to deoxyhemoglobin (arrow). T2-FLAIR (middle) and T2 (right) images obtained at 0.064T show the center of the hematoma to be relatively isointense to brain. It is still diagnosable as at hematoma when its shape and edematous margin is appreciated. (From Mazurek et al under CC-BY) At very low fields (below 0.10 T) in acute/subacute hematomas a new finding, central T1-hyperintensity, occurs. This interesting observation, described nearly 40 years ago, has been largely overlooked as the world focused on high-field imaging. The T1-hyperintensity is thought to be the result of hemoconcentration and increased protein in the clot, a phenomenon replicated using in vitro models. Acute hematoma imaged by CT (left) and 0.02 T MRI. Note the high signal in the T1-weighted IR image (middle, arrow). The image on the right is T2-weighted, showing once again a central region isointense to brain. (From Sipponen et al with permission of publisher). Acute hematoma imaged by CT (left) and 0.17T MRI.

Between about 1995 and 2005, high-dose gadolinium contrast was being promoted by some centers as an alternative to iodinated contrast for catheter angiography in patients with renal failure or insufficiency. The required gadolinium doses to achieve adequate x-ray opacification were very high (3-10x normal intravenous doses), and cases of gadolinium-contrast induced nephropathy began to appear. The use gadolinium at any dose level in patients with severe renal disease was ended in the late 2000's due to the recognition of its association with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . In high doses gadolinium contrast can therefore definitely be nephrotoxic to patients with pre-existing renal disease. But c an patients with either normal or impaired function receive gadolinium in regular (0.1 mmol/kg) dosage without fear of renal damage? I personally believe the answer is \"Yes\", but admittedly science has not completely answered this question. The review article by Martino et al summarizes evidence that regular dose gadolinium, given even to patients in moderate to severe renal failure, does not precipitate overt acute kidney injury or changes in serum creatinine. Nevertheless, a number of human and animal studies have demonstrated transient increases in some sensitive urine markers for renal tubular injury (NAG, KIM1, NGAL, IL18) after gadolinium administration. Thus there remains some concern that gadolinium contrast agents in normal doses may cause very subtle renal injury.

Moreover, we do not reduce gadolinium dose or check GFR before or after the exam.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/renal-toxicity.html"}

The first step toward full quantification of a DCE study is determining the concentration of tissue gadolinium [Gd] from the magnitude of the MR signal. The process is similar to that used for DSC imaging  that the change in T1-relaxation rate, R1 (=1/T1), is directly proportional to [Gd]. Note that this assumption is true only for dilute aqueous solutions of contrast and hence may not strictly apply to tissues where macromolecular interactions affect relaxivity and compartmentalization may alter the fast exchange of water. The usual DCE pulse sequence is a spoiled gradient echo (FLASH/SPGR/T1-FFE) whose signal intensity ( S ) is given by Here k is a scaling constant, [H] is spin density, and  is the RF flip angle. The relationship between signal intensity and T1 is not as straightforward as the simple logarithmic ratio described for DSC, but can still be determined. The precision of this calculation depends upon knowledge of the background tissue T1 without contrast. This value may be obtained by a separate precontrast calibration sequence (preferred) or estimated from population averages. Without this calibration only relative gadolinium concentrations can be determined from the MR signal. Finally, because gadolinium-based contrast agents distribute in plasma rather than whole blood, their effective plasma concentrations must be considered. The ratio of plasma to whole blood depends on the hematocrit ( Hct = % of red blood cells), giving the relationship: [Gd] blood = [Gd] plasma  ( 1 Hct ). For a typical normal Hct = 40%, the gadolinium concentration is plasma is therefore approximately 1.7 times higher than that measured in whole blood. Note that the hematocrit may vary in the same patient over time, especially in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Changing Hct may thus significantly affect serial quantitive DCE measurements if adjustments are not made. Another factor not frequently considered in most DCE calculations is that Hct is a factor of 2 or more lower in capillaries (where gadolinium exchange occurs) than in larger arteries ( Fhraeus effect ).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dce-signal-v-gd.html"}

As described in a prior Q&A , TrueFISP generates high intravascular signal relative to other tissues due to the intrinsically high T2/T1 ratio of blood.

Cine studies are typically obtained by repeatedly imaging the heart at a single slice location throughout the cardiac cycle. Between 10 and 30 cardiac phases are usually sampled. To avoid confusion with other uses of the term \" phase \" in MRI, these individual cardiac images are often referred to as \"frames\" or \"segments\". To fully evaluate the entire heart, separate cine image sets at various locations must be obtained. For example, a standard cine study might include three sets of short-axis images (base, mid-ventricle, and apex), three sets of long-axis images (2-, 3-, and 4-chamber), plus valvular and outflow tract images as needed.

In most modern MR scanners, however, RF transmission and reception functions have been largely separated and delegated to two different types of coils. In the typical arrangement, RF-transmission is performed by a body RF-coil (of the birdcage or TEM variety) located just beneath the inner wall of the scanner bore. RF-reception is delegated to one or more surface coils placed close to the patient's body as illustrated in the diagram above.

Progressive signal loss of vertebral arteries due to saturation effects as they travel more deeply into the slab The relative saturation between flowing blood and stationary tissue can be controlled by adjusting the RF-flip angle (  ). In general, higher flip angles produce greater degrees of background saturation. Normally an RF-pulse is designed to produce a constant flip angle across its entire volume of excitation. Ramped RF-pulses are a special class of asymmetric pulses with flip angles that vary as a function of position. In those most commonly used for MRA, the flip angle is made to increase linearly along the direction of flow. For example, the flip angle might be 20 at the entry slice, 30 at mid-slab, and 40 near the exiting slice.

Amide Proton Transfer (APT) imaging is a relatively new method using off-resonance saturation pulses to detect mobile proteins and peptides in biological tissues.

Grade 2 glioma (low cellularity) Grade 2 glioma (low APT values) Grade 4 glioma (high cellularity) Grade 4 glioma (high APT values) APT imaging of low versus high grade gliomas (From Bai et al 2017 under CC BY) APT, like Magnetization Transfer (MT) imaging , is a subset of a more general class of methods known as Chemical Exchange Saturation Techniques (CEST) . The basic concept is that proteins and other macromolecules can absorb RF energy at frequencies applied a few hundred to a few thousand Hz away from the pure water resonance. When such an \"off-resonance\" RF-pulse is applied, energy absorbed by macromolecules is then transferred via chemical exchange and dipolar interactions to the water resonance, lowering its signal. The degree of signal suppression will be greatest for tissues with high protein content and high rates of water-macromolecular interactions. An amide functional group is defined as a nitrogen (N) attached to a carbonyl (C=O) group. The R's may be hydrogens (H) or an alkane. Although general magnetization transfer effects are broad and non-specific, it is possible to hone in on a group of mobile proteins and peptides known as amides , which exist at reasonable concentrations (~5-8 mM) and which can be selectively stimulated by off-resonance RF-pulses applied at approximately 3.5 ppm downfield from the water resonance (i.e., at   8.2 ppm). To isolate the effect of amide proton transfer from that of other background macromolecules, the APT pulse sequence uses 8-10 RF-pulses of slightly different off-resonance frequencies clustered near both +3.5 ppm (at   8.2) and  3.5 ppm (at   1.2) symmetrically on each side of the water resonance. After correction for B o nonuniformities and measurement of baseline signal ( S o ) in the absence of RF-pulses, APT suppression is calculated using subtraction on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Such APT values in tissues typically range between 0 and 5% and can be displayed as color maps overlaid on conventional images.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/amide-proton-transfer.html"}

So often the protons or nuclei possessing spin and giving rise to the MR signal are simply called spins . The equivalency between the three terms (nuclei, protons, spins) breaks down when higher atomic number elements (such as Na and P that also undergo NMR) are considered. The nuclei of these elements contain multiple protons and neutrons, so now nucleus  proton. NMR is the property of the entire nucleus, not just protons. So when talking about imaging or spectroscopy of nuclei other than hydrogen, it is best to avoid using terms like \"proton\" or \"proton density.\" As these higher order nuclei still possess spin, it is appropriate to use continue to use the nucleus  spin equivalency.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/proton--nucleus--spin.html"}

Standard diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) methods have incorporated Einstein's original concept that the diffusion water molecules follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution. While this assumption may be true for pure liquids and gels, it is most certainly incorrect for complex biological tissues with cell membranes that create compartments and barriers to diffusion. Non-Gaussian behavior becomes more noticeable when stronger gradients (higher b -values) and longer echo times are used. Probability distributions reflecting the distance a water molecule would likely diffuse in a fixed time interval. Diffusion in pure liquids follows Gaussian statistics, but tissue diffusion is characterized by positive kurtosis. Kurtosis , denoted by the dimensionless parameter K , is a long recognized statistical metric for quantifying the shape of a probability distribution. By definition, a Gaussian distribution has K = 0. Distributions that are more \"peaked\" and with less weight on their \"shoulders\" typically have a positive kurtosis ( K >0). Diffusion in pure fluids is Gaussian, but biological tissues are characterized by a positive diffusion kurtosis. This reflects the heterogeneous diffusion environments experienced by water molecules as they encounter barriers, move between compartments, and undergo chemical exchange. A water molecule diffusing according to a K >0 distribution would typically not travel as far in a given time interval as one that followed Gaussian ( K =0) statistics. With Gaussian diffusion the predicted MR signal ( S ) relative to baseline ( S o ) during application of diffusion-sensitizing gradients can be expressed as S = S o e  bD or S / S o = e  bD where D is the apparent (or measured) diffusion coefficient and b is a factor reflecting the strength and duration of the pulsed diffusion gradients. Under this model, a semilogarithmic plot of signal attenuation ln( S / S o ) vs b should be a straight line with slope = D . Deviation of the expected MR signal in DWI from a mono-exponential model. At low b -values IVIM effects due to microscopic perfusion must be considered (red), while at high b -values kurtosis effects must be considered (green). In the prior Q&A we showed how at low b -values intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) perfusion in capillaries caused a deviation of measured data from this expected line. The effect of diffusion kurtosis (green region) is best appreciated at high b -values (i.e.,  1500 s/mm). Kurtosis produces a deviation of the graph in a direction opposite to IVIM perfusion, resulting in lower than expected apparent diffusion coefficient. A common method to account for kurtosis is to perform a one-step Taylor series expansion of the exponent in the standard diffusion signal equation above, yielding S = S o e  bD + bDK/6 Acute cerebral infarction shown by trace DWI, ADC map, and mean kurtosis image. Note decreased kurtosis in center of DK image which is not appreciated on conventional DWI or ADC maps. This area corresponds to the more cystic area of infarction seen on the T2-FLAIR image 6 months later. (From Hori et al under CC BY) By acquiring data in several directions and different b -values (the largest in the 20003000 s/ mm range), variables in this equation can be estimated. The value of D obtained can be thought of as the apparent diffusion coefficient corrected for kurtosis, while K can be considered the apparent or mean kurtosis averaged over three cardinal directions. In cranial imaging typical calculated kurtosis values might range from K = 0 for CSF to K = 0.7 for gray matter to K =1.0 for white matter. Analogous to DTI it is possible to create diffusion kurtosis tensors and, for example, estimate axial and radial components of kurtosis. At least 15 different diffusion directions and two non-zero b -values must be probed to create such a tensor. Several even more complex methods, including q-Ball imaging and diffusion spectrum imaging , are briefly described in the", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/diffusion-kurtosis.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding The American College of Radiology (ACR) and VA Health Care recommend , while The Joint Commission (TJC) and Facilities Guideline Institute (FGI) require, that all new and renovated MRI suites be equipped with Ferromagnetic Detection Systems (FMDS) . Unlike airport security devices that alarm on all metals, FMDS detect only ferromagnetic objects (i.e., those that could potentially become projectiles in a strong magnetic field). Both stationary and hand-held FMDS are available. Stationary devices, also known as pillar detectors, are typically mounted on either side of the doorway to the MR scanner. When someone walks through (or is pushed through on a stretcher) the FMDS senses if the ambient magnetic field has been disturbed by a ferromagnetic object. FMDS can also be used in ACR Area II as an adjunct to initial patient screening. If the ferromagnetic object cannot be immediately located, a hand-held device can then be used to find it. Pillar-type Ferroguard FMDS From Metrasens.com FerrAlert Hand-held FMDS from koppdevelopment.com FMDS are designed primarily to detect ferromagnetic objects outside the patient and do so with very high sensitivity and specificity. They may also be used to detect internal ferromagnetic objects, though their reliability in this regard is still under investigation. Notwithstanding the enthusiasm of many authorities, I am not at all a big proponent of these devices. I always worried that technologists might become overly dependent on them and not do as careful a job screening patients personally. Additionally, a non-trivial number false alarms occur (though the newest models claim to be more accurate). Some of the alarms are true-positives, but \"extraneous\", such as when a technologist walks through the portal wearing ferromagnetic materials, such as shoe tangs, dental braces, bra clasps, or underwires. Some fully MR compatible devices containing a few tiny internal ferromagnetic parts will set off the alarms although they are safe to use. The end result can be \"alarm fatigue\" where technologists subconsciously fail to hear or heed the beeps. Finally the fact that these devices detect only ferromagnetic materials is also a disadvantage. They will not detect non-ferromagnetic metals (like copper or aluminum) that may be present in EKG leads, piercings, and drug patches -- all of which can be associated with electrical burns and which must be identified prior to MR imaging. In truth, burns are a far more common problem than projectile injuries, which are distinctly rare.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/metal-detectors.html"}

Most major MR manufacturers offer basic integrated fMRI processing software (e.g., GE's BrainWave , Philips I View BOLD ) as an optional purchase. These are probably adequate for the majority of simple task-based fMRI studies used for clinical cortex mapping, but more complex experiments will likely require third-party solutions. Many third-party software programs are free and open source. Some provide robust tool sets for experimental design, processing, and data analysis, while others are more \"bare-boned\". I won't take sides here as to which ones are the best, but I did grow up with SPM and am most familiar with it. Below is a summary of the most widely used independent fMRI software listed alphabetically. AFNI (Analysis of Functional Neuroimaging) is an extensive free set of C-based programs for processing, analyzing, and displaying fMRI data. Originally developed by Robert Cox at Medical College of Wisconsin in the mid-1990s, AFNI is now hosted at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, MD. Add-on tools include a skull-stripping program and SUMA for cortical surface-based fMRI analysis. Runs on Unix, SGI, Solaris, Linux and Mac OS X. Available at this link . Brain Connectivity Toolbox contains over 120 brain connectivity and statistical functions primarily designed for complex network (graphical) analysis, most widely used to analyze resting-state fMRI studies. This free site is the work of multiple investigators, primarily Olaf Sporns at Indiana University and Mikail Rubinov at Cambridge. MATLAB is required, although some functions will run in Octave. Available at this link. BrainSuite is a collection of open source software tools for largely automated brain MRI processing. It was produced and distributed as a collaborative project between the research groups of David Shattuck at UCLA and Richard Leahy at USC. The major functionality is for extraction and parameterization of the inner and outer surfaces of the cerebral cortex and to analyze diffusion MRI data. It is available for 64-bit Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux. Available at this link . BrainVISA , from the Institut Fdratif de Recherche n49 (IFR), France, is a free neuroimaging software platform for mass data analysis. Works on Windows, Unix/MacOS, and LInux systems and interfaces with FreeSurfer. Customizable modules include toolboxes for brain segmentation, cortical sulci recognition and morphometry, interactive 3D visualization, and cortical surface parameterization and analysis. Available at this link . Brain Voyager is a comprehensive suite of commercial programs for functional imaging analysis and visualization, including not only fMRI, but also DTI, EEG, and MEG. Add-on modules for TMS neuronavigation, fMRI biofeedback, and neural network simulation are also available. Based in the Netherlands, CEO Rainer Goebel originally developed this platform in the mid-1990s. It runs on all major computer platforms, including Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. It has excellent on-line manuals that explain the operation of the software and are quite educational about fMRI processing in general. Available at this link. FreeSurfer is an open source software suite for processing and analyzing brain MR images. It was developed by Bruce Fischl and his team in the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Harvard/MGH Martinos Center. The software is comprehensive and includes modules for skull stripping, image registration, segmentation, cortical topology, fMRI analysis, and tractography. PET data analysis can also be performed. The real power of this software lies in its cortical and subcortical analysis tools for measuring, inflating or flattening the cortical surface and performing multi-subject fMRI statistics thereon. FreeSurfer integrates (albeit somewhat clumsily) with FSL and the MNI's Brain Imaging Software Toolbox. It runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows (via VirtualBox). An extensive Wiki and on-line tutorials are available. Here is the link. FSL (FMRIB Software Library) is a free suite of applications from Oxford's Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) laboratory. The first release of this software was in 2000, and FSL has continued to grow exponentially since that time. It is designed primarily for Mac OS X and Linux, but can be used on Windows in a Virtual Machine environment. Several dozen tool sets are available that run as separate programs. The most widely used modules include FEAT (a model-based analysis for task fMRI), MELODIC (a model-free ICA-based analysis for resting state fMRI), BET (for brain extraction), FAST (for tissue segmentation), and MCFLIRT (for motion correction). Tools are also available for diffusion tractography and analysis, as well as ASL-based fMRI and perfusion measurements. Many third party plug-ins are available. FSL can be accessed at this link . MIALAB (Medical Image Analysis Lab) , headed by Vince Calhoun at the University of New Mexico, has developed a set of free MATLAB-based software for brain imaging analysis. Their group's independent component analysis toolbox (GIFT) is the most widely used . Here is the link . REST (RESting-state fMRI data analysis Toolkit) is a group of applications based on MATLAB and SPM8 for evaluation of resting-state fMRI data. It was conceived and designed under a team at the Beijing Normal University. The software offers data exchange/sharing with SPM, AFNI, and FSL. Its pipeline and flexible modules can perform a full range of preprocessing steps (e.g., slice timing, motion correction, detrending), but its real strength lies in analysis of RS-fMRI data (e.g., correlation-based functional connectivity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation analysis, Granger causality). The main software application is available at this link. REST is also embedded in a more comprehensive website with links to other RS and connectivity applications, The R-fMRI Network (rfmr.org) . SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) was created in the late 1980s by Karl Friston to analyze PET images at the voxel level. Within five years SPM became the dominant method for the analysis of PET data as well as for the (fledgling) technique known as fMRI. Today SPM is in its 12th release under continuous development from members and collaborators of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London. SPM is a free and works under Windows, Linus, and Mac OS X as long as core MATLAB is installed. SPM has virtually every feature one might need for fMRI processing, analysis, and display. Like most other fMRI software, SPM employs the General Linear Model (GLM) for its primary analysis, as Friston was one of the early proponents of this technique.

The process of ramping a superconducting magnet up to full field is typically a 2-3 day process. After the magnet is sited and ready, it is cooled to superconductive temperatures by being filled with liquid helium (at least up to the ~75% level). The electrical terminals to charge the coil windings are located deep within the cryostat. In many designs these are accessed by inserting plungers into the magnet as shown in the video to the right. During ramping, a heater circuit is turned on causing a finite resistance to develop in resistor R. Once current begins to flow, the heater is turned off, and the resistance of R falls to zero, allowing the current to continue indefinitely through the superconducting loop in \"persistence mode\". A simplified diagram of the internal magnet circuitry is shown to the left. In parallel with the main coil windings is a by-pass limb containing a component called a persistence switch . The persistence switch is comprised of a resistor ( R ) and a small electric heater. The persistence resistor ( R ) is heated above superconducting temperatures so it develops a small finite resistance (~100  typical). The service engineer next attaches a power supply to the plungers and begins pumping current into the system. Because the magnet coils are superconducting (and have essentially zero resistance) virtually all of the applied current flows directly through them and little to none flows through the persistence limb. The external current is slowly increased over a 24-48 hour period (to avoid a quench) until the desired final current level (typically 500-1000 A) and field strength are attained. At this time the heater element is turned off and as the resistor ( R ) cools it becomes superconductive, shorting the circuit across the coils. The external power supply is now disconnected and the magnet current continues indefinitely through the superconductive loop in persistence mode . Finally, t he plungers are removed and the fully ramped magnet is ready for the next stage of installation (typically shimming).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-to-ramp.html"}

T1 relaxation is the process by which the net magnetization ( M ) grows/returns to its initial maximum value (M o ) parallel to B o . S ynonyms for T1 relaxation include l ongitudinal relaxation , thermal relaxation and spin-lattice relaxation . The meanings and implications of these synonyms will become apparent shortly. T1 relaxation is the process by which the net magnetiztion (M) returns to its initial maximum value (Mo). In his landmark 1946 paper describing \"nuclear induction\" (today called NMR), Felix Bloch modeled this process as a simple exponential with T1 as a first-order time constant. Graphically, therefore, T1 can be viewed as the time required for the z -component of M to reach ( 1  1/e ) or about 63% of its maximum value (M o ). In biological materials, T1 values ranging from a few tenths of a second to several seconds are typically found. Longitudinal relaxation is modeled as exponential growth curve with time constant T1. M reaches 63% of its maximum value (Mo) at t = T1 and is very close to maximal at t = 5 x T1. The growth of M toward Bo is accompanied by reduction in energy within the spin system. As the longitudinal component of M ( M z ) grows toward M o , the energy of the spin system decreases. Why? Because statistically more spins are \"favoring\" the lower energy (spin-up, parallel) orientation. (Remember, these spins don't actually reside in pure \"spin-up\" states, it is just that the expected value of their aggregate angular momentum comes to lie increasingly in that direction). Energy must therefore leave the spin system for T1 relaxation to occur. This energy loss is unrecoverable and represents the transfer of heat; hence the origin of the T1 synonym \" thermal relaxation\" . This energy must be transferred somewhere, and that \"somewhere\" is into nearby nuclei, atoms, and molecules through collisions, rotations, or electromagnetic interactions. At the most basic level, therefore, T1-r elaxation is simply an energy flow between spins and their external environment. The amount of energy transferred from the nuclei is very small compared to normal molecular kinetic energies, so it is quickly dispersed and goes largely unnoticed at body temperatures. In the early days of NMR studies in solids, this external environment was literally a crystalline lattice of atoms, giving origin to the T1 synonym \" spin-lattice relaxation \". Because biological NMR and MRI deals principally with liquids and gels rather than crystalline solids, I prefer to avoid the word \" lattice \" and call the process either longitudinal or T1-relaxation . As described in a previous Q&A , spontaneous emission of energy is extremely unlikely in the NMR range of frequencies. All energy emission in NMR must be stimulated through encounter of the nucleus with another magnetic field fluctuating near the Larmor frequency. The source of the locally fluctuating field necessary to induce relaxation is typically another proton or electron on the same or a nearby molecule. Just like the B 1 field that originally excited nuclei into resonance, the RF-fields causing T1-relaxation must fluctuate near the Larmor frequency in the transverse plane . The major difference between the original B 1 field and fluctuating fields responsible for T1-relaxation is that the B 1 field affects all spins in the sample uniformly. In relaxation, the fields are local, random in magnitude, and affect only a few spins. The major \"take-home\" points about T1-relaxation are listed below. T1 Relaxation Summary  T1 is the time constant for regrowth of longitudinal magnetization ( M z )  Synonyms: Spin-lattice relaxation, thermal relaxation, longitudinal relaxation  Requires energy transfer from spins to environment (\"lattice\")  Energy transfer must be stimulated  Stimulation by transverse field fluctuating near the Larmor frequency  Source of fluctuating field is molecular motion of a nearby proton or electron", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-t1.html"}

Why don't these behave the same way? To the right are images of a brain tumor with intrinsically long T1 and T2 values having opposite intensities on T1- and T2-weighted images. To understand this \"paradox\", you must realize that a pixel's \"brightness\" or \"darkness\" on an MR image is directly related to the magnitude of the detected MR signal. The magnitude of the MR signal after an RF-pulse is in turn, dependent on two factors: T1-weighted image T2-weighted image The size of M z , the z -component of tissue magnetization ( M ) before the RF-pulse. The size of M xy , the transverse components of M after the RF-pulse ( when the signal is recorded). T1 reflects the length of time it takes for regrowth of M z back toward its initial maximum value ( M o ). Tissues with short T1's recover more quickly than those with long T1's. Their M z values are larger, producing a stronger signal and brighter spot on the MR image. T2 reflects the length of time it takes for the MR signal to decay in the transverse plane.

After acquiring fMRI and anatomic scans, several steps are needed to transform this raw data into meaningful information. In summary, the main stages are: Preprocessing of raw fMRI data involves recognition of outlier data followed by multiple steps to correct for noise, motion, signal drifts, slice timing discrepancies, and spatial distortions. The preprocessed BOLD data can then be overlaid on the subject's own anatomic brain images ( coregistration ) or warped onto a generic brain template ( normalization ). Statistical analysis can then be performed using a variety of methods, the most common being a single voxel-based matrix algebra approach known as the General Linear Model (GLM) . Other methods (more commonly used for resting-state fMRI ) include correlation analysis and independent component analysis (ICA) . Although sophisticated analyses are typically performed \"off-line\" after completion of data collection, basic statistical maps can be incrementally computed and displayed while fMRI data is being acquired. Such real-time analysis permits immediate identification of data collection problems, allowing scans to be repeated while the patient is still in the scanner. Maps are then created to show brain areas whose levels of activation correlate most strongly with experimental manipulations, behavior, performance, or the activity of other brain regions. Data from a single person, scanned repeatedly under different experimental conditions, may be used to created single-subject maps . For population-based studies, data from multiple individuals may be combined and displayed as group-level maps . More sophisticated overlays can be created using mesh-based surface reconstruction , tissue segmentation , and cortex inflation or flattening . Functional connectivity maps using seed-based or ICA correlation techniques may be generated, sometimes displayed as graphs with nodes and links. Interpretation of results depends on the experimental design and must always be placed in the context of established neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. In forward inference experiments, we attempt to conclude that a certain task (e.g. finger tapping) produces a specific region of BOLD activation. In reverse inference experiments the converse is attempted  to conclude that BOLD activation of a certain brain region means the subject is doing or feeling something (e.g. anger, pain). Reverse inference experiments are much trickier to perform and interpret; the literature is replete with false conclusions drawn from them. The third class of experiments, multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) , uses a combination of forward and reverse inference. Machine learning may be employed first to classify activation patterns from various stimuli, then later used to predict stimuli from observed patterns of brain activity. These steps will all be described in much more detail in subsequent Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/processanalyze-fmri.html"}

Angular momentum is a form of inertia, reflecting the object's size, shape, mass, and rotational velocity. It is typically represented as a vector ( L ) pointing along the axis of rotation. Atomic and subatomic particles posses a corresponding property known as spin or spin angular momentum. Protons, neutrons, whole nuclei, and electrons all possess spin and are often represented as tiny spinning balls. Although inaccurate, this is not a terribly bad way to think about spin as long as you do not take the analogy too far. Several key differences should be recognized: The particle is not actually spinning or rotating. Spin , like mass, is a fundamental property of nature and does not arise from more basic mechanisms. Spin interacts with electromagnetic fields whereas classic angular momentum (L) interacts with gravitational fields. The magnitude of spin is quantized , meaning that it can only take on a limited set of discrete values. Angular momentum (L) vector points along axis of rotation. Representation of a \"spinning\" nucleus with non-zero quantum spin (I) Quantum mechanics is the branch of modern physics explaining how phenomena like spin operate at the atomic level including its restriction to discrete values. This is a \"bizarro\" world to be sure, and many of the results are unexpected and non-intuitive. Unlike macroscopic angular momentum, spin can only be measured discrete integer or half-integer units (0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, ...) Protons, neutrons, and electrons all have spin = . Although exactly the same property, nuclear spin is traditionally denoted by the letter I , while electron spin is denoted by the letter S . Electron spin has only one value ( S = , always), but nuclear spin values ranging from I = 0 to I = 8 in -unit increments can be found across the entire periodic table. H, the nucleus most commonly used for NMR and MRI, has I = , the same spin as the single proton of which it is composed. Only nuclei with non-zero spins (I  0) can absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation and undergo \"resonance\" when placed in a magnetic field.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-spin.html"}

A relative large number of intracranial diseases can show restricted diffusion and may therefore appear bright on diffusion-weighted images. An incomplete listing by category of disease is shown below, with the most common examples highlighted in red: Intracranial diseases with restricted diffusion (bright on DW images) The mechanisms responsible for restricted diffusion are incompletely understood and depend on the particular disease being considered. For many disorders several processes may act in concert to reduce the ADC. Cerebral Infarction Restricted diffusion typically occurs within 30-120 minutes after a cerebral infarction, returning to normal by 10-14 days. The principal mechanisms are thought to be: Increase in intracellular water . With cell death or insufficient intracellular energy metabolism, membrane pumps responsible for maintaining ionic gradients fail and swelling ( cytotoxic edema ) develops. Reduction in extracellular space . This occurs as a consequence of cellular swelling, resulting in increased tortuosity of extracellular pathways. Fragmentation of cellular components . With cell death or rupture, cellular components (membranes, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, proteins, etc) dissociate, fragment, and unravel. Both intracellular and extracellular viscosity increases. 2-day-old cerebral infarction Neoplasms The vast majority of neoplasms do not restrict diffusion or change it only mildly. A few interesting tumors, including lymphomas and some highly malignant gliomas, may show significant restriction of diffusion and thus appear remarkably bright on DW images. The ADC values of tumors is inversely correlated with cellularity . Cell walls form barriers to the diffusion of water molecule and so the more cells, the more barriers. If the packing density is very efficient, then the amount of extracellular space (where diffusion is normally freer) is also reduced. Uniform small round or hexagonal cells (as seen in lymphomas, medulloblastomas, and PNETs) pack more efficiently into the same volume than larger, irregular cells. So we would expect their ADC values to be correspondingly smaller. Lymphoma Abscess/Empyema Cerebral abscess Bacterial abscesses and empyemas reliably demonstrate restricted diffusion, and DWI has proved useful in distinguishing abscesses from necrotic tumors, resolving hematomas, and other fluid-filled cavities. The restricted diffusion in abscesses is thought to be due to the presence of viscous fluid containing cellular debris, bacteria, inflammatory cells, and mucoid proteins. Animal models have shown an inverse correlation between cellular density and ADC. And from the Stokes-Einstein equations diffusivity is inversely proportional to viscosity. As treated abscesses mature, central liquifaction occurs and T2-\"shine-through\" gradually replaces the ADC-driven high signal on DW images. Toxic/Metabolic/Demyelinating Intramyelinic edema with separation of myelin sheath layers Reversible DWI+ lesion of the splenium due to intramyelinic edema post seizure A wide range of toxic, metabolic, and demyelinating processes may result in restricted diffusion within the white matter. The high signal seen on DW images in these conditions may be fully reversible and does not necessarily imply cell death (as it does in infarction). Diverse disorders such as hyperglycemia, osmotic demyelination syndrome, methotrexate encephalopathy, heroin toxicity, and phenylketonuria all share a final common pathway of brain injury, mediated by the release of excitotoxic amino acid neurotransmitters, especially glutamate. Excessive extracellular glutamate depolarizes adjacent injured neurons and glia. When glutamate binds to surface receptors it increases the flux of Na+ and Ca++ into cells, resulting in swelling and the initiation of apoptosis (programmed cell death). This becomes a vicious cycle resulting in the release of more glutamate with progressive cellular damage. Fluid begins to collect between the layers of myelin in the axonal sheath, a phenomenon known as intramyelinic edema . The extracellular water in these myelin clefts is restricted in its movement and thought responsible for low white matter ADC values seen in these conditions.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dwi-bright-causes.html"}

A wide range of statistical methods are available to analyze fMRI data. Some are more appropriate for task-based fMRI while others are more applicable to resting-state studies. The most commonly used ones are briefly described below. Correlation Analysis The degree of temporal synchrony between two time series X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,  and Y = y 1 , y 2 , y 3 ,  can be expressed by the correlation coefficient (r) calculated as Correlation graph for pairs of 30 different brain regions in rs-fMRI experiment. (From nipy.org under CC license)  where r = 0 implies no correlation, r = 1 perfect correlation, and = 1 perfect anti-correlation. Correlation methodology was one of the earliest techniques applied to task-based fMRI studies in the 1990s. In this setting Y was the time course of the fMRI signal from a single voxel while X was the expected hemodynamic response to a task or stimulus. Voxels with larger r -values had signals more highly correlated to the input and hence were considered relatively activated. Today correlation analysis is more commonly used for resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI ), where X and Y are the MRI signals from two different voxels or brain regions. Here higher r -values reflect greater connectivity between pairs of areas and assist in neural network modeling. General Linear Model (GLM) The General Linear Model (GLM) is an extension of simple correlation and regression that has evolved into the workhorse technique for analysis of task/stimulus-based fMRI experiments over the last 25 years. GLM is the default method provided by all MR vendors in their clinical fMRI packages and is also widely available in third party software. Often expressed in matrix algebra form, the GLM can be written Y =  0 +  1 X 1 +  2 X 2 +  +  This equation states that the fMRI signa l (Y) for a given voxel can be expressed as the sum of one or more experimental design variables ( X 1 , X 2 , ) , each multiplied by a weighting factor ( 1 ,  2 , ) , plus a random error term (  ) . There is usually one X i for each type of stimulus or event presented to the subject. Most models also contain additional X i \"nuisance regressors\" to account for motion or signal drift. Statistical Parametic Map (SPM) overlaid on anatomic image Once the design variables ( X i ) and recorded signals (Y) have been loaded into the GLM, a least squares optimization procedure calculates values for the weighting factors (  1 ,  2 ,  ) corresponding to each design variable. Because the data fit will not be perfect, small errors (  i ), also called residuals , will be generated for each time point. Various statistical tools (such as t- and F-tests ) can then be applied to explore other features of the data, such as the degree of correlation between variables, assessment of linearity, and comparisons between populations. The final output is usually a Statistical Parametric Map (SPM) overlaid on an anatomic image or template. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) Spatial ICA separates signals from visual cortex into three components. The goal of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is to detect underlying patterns present in the fMRI signal without prior knowledge of the experimental task or shape of the hemodynamic response function. ICA is thus considered a model free method for blind source signal separation , allowing identification of unknown independent signals that have been linearly mixed together. For example, ICA methods could be used extract individual voices, music, and noise elements from an audio mixture recorded at a cocktail party without prior knowledge of their sources or locations. As applied to fMRI data, ICA may distinguish meaningful areas of correlated brain activation from random and semi-periodic physiological noise. Although ICA can be used in conjunction with GLM methods for task-based experiments, it has found its most widespread application for the analysis of resting-state fMRI data. Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and Networks From Haxby et al (2001) Multi-Voxel (Multi-Variate) Pattern Analysis (MVPA) seeks to discover spatial patterns of fMRI activity corresponding to different experimental conditions. Such knowledge might allow us to decode mental states, such as what a person is thinking or feeling, merely by observing fMRI data. Unlike ICA, MVPA is model-based, and a wide range of MPVA techniques are available depending on the needs of a particular experiment and the psychologic-physiologic questions to be answered. One aspect to be considered is the spatial scope of the analysis. The searchlight approach creates thousands of localized multivariate predictive models; while the whole - brain approach develops a single predictive model across applied diffusely. Brain network graph Because of the brain's extraordinary complexity, an important role for machine learning has emerged -- the use of computer algorithms to discern complex patterns from empirical data for making models and decisions. This, in turn, has led to multiple methods of for expressing connectivity -- through graphs, network maps, and quantitative measures. The NIH-sponsored Human Connectome Project is an example of the importance of developing a public fMRI data base and processing algorithms for better understanding of brain connectivity.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fmri-statistical-analysis.html"}

VENC stands for velocity encoding , a parameter that must be specified before performing a phase-contrast (PC) MRI or MRA study. VENC, measured in cm/sec, should be chosen to encompass the highest velocities likely to be encountered within the vessel of interest. If VENC is set to 50 cm/sec, for example, flows in the range of 50 cm/sec can be accurately represented by a set of phase shifts spanning from 180 to +180. The VENC parameter adjusts the strength of the bipolar gradients so that the maximum velocity selected corresponds to a 180 phase shift in the data. VENC is inversely related to the size of these gradients. Larger gradients create more dephasing and correspond to smaller values of VENC. The VENC setting is critical for proper performance of the PC pulse sequence, but usually can only be estimated since its optimal value is generally not known in advance. Often a study will be repeated using 2-3 different VENCs based on typical velocities expected. If the selected VENC is set too high, the range of flows imaged will span only a limited phase shift range. The signal-to-noise of the image and quality of the data will suffer. Small velocity differences on flow studies will not be distinguishable, and vessels with slow flow may be impossible to see. If VENC is picked too low, velocity aliasing may occur with faster flows not being appropriately represented. For example, if the chosen value of VENC is 50 cm/sec, the bipolar gradient is adjusted so that a flows of +25 and +50 cm/sec are assigned a phases of +90 and +180 respectively. If the actual velocity is +75 cm/sec, this flow will be mapped to +270, a value that cannot be distinguished from a phase shift of 90. Instead of representing the +75-cm/sec flow as its actual velocity, the computer will assign it a flow of 25 cm/sec in the opposite direction! Velocity aliasing occurs when VENC is set too low. Proper estimation of VENC is thus critical for successful of PC angiography. As a general rule, choosing VENC about 2025% higher than the maximum expected flow velocity is advised.

For most fluids and some homogeneous solid materials like gels, diffusion is the same in every direction. These substances are called isotropic and are characterized by a single diffusion coefficient (D) . Biological tissues, on the other hand, are highly structured and typically have different diffusion coefficients along different directions and are called anisotropic . Virtually all biological materials demonstrate some degree of anisotropy. White matter is highly ansiotropic because of the parallel orientation of its nerve fiber tracts. Other tissues demonstrating significant anisotropy include skeletal muscle and tendons. Dissected brain showing white matter tracts In anisotropic materials, diffusion cannot be described by a single number, but a [3 x 3] array called the diffusion tensor . The three diagonal elements ( D xx , D yy , D zz ) of the tensor represent diffusion coefficients measured in the laboratory frame of reference along each of the principal ( x-, y- and z -) directions. The six off-diagonal terms ( D xy , D yz , etc) reflect correlation between random motions corresponding to each pair of principal directions. For the special case of perfect isotropic diffusion (such as seen in pure liquids), the off-diagonal elements are all zero. The diagonal elements are all the same and equal the single diffusion coefficient, D , for the isotropic material (i.e., D xx = D yy = D zz = D ). The concepts of diffusion anisotropy and the diffusion tensor underlie many advanced processing techniques including DT imaging, fractional anisotropy imaging, and MR tractography.

The original MP-RAGE (Magnetization Prepared - RApid Gradient Echo) was introduced in a prior Q&A dealing with inversion preparation methods. Since its development nearly 30 years ago, MP-RAGE has become the dominant sequence for 3D-T1-weighted imaging especially on Siemens scanners. As shown in the schematic below, MP-RAGE consists of a non-selective (180) inversion pulse followed by a collection of rapidly acquired gradient echoes obtained at short TE's (2-4 ms) and small flip angles  (5- 12). A medium inversion time ( TI ) of 600-900 ms and long repetition time ( TR ) of approximately 2000 ms are typical. Schematic of the MP-RAGE sequence (imaging gradients have been omitted for clarity). The standard Siemens implementation of MP-RAGE is as a 3DFT technique. Following the non-selective 180 pulse, M z is inverted and allowed to regrow via T1 relaxation mechanisms over inversion time interval ( TI ), at which time signal is acquired by using a spoiled GRE (Turbo-FLASH) with low flip angle. Sequential ordering is typically used for both in-plane (G y ) and slice-select (G z ) phase encoding. All the (G z ) phase-encoding lines are collected following the inversion pulse, then repeated for the next value of the G y gradient, and so forth. Because the number of partitions (G z phase steps) is usually smaller than the number of G y steps, this strategy results in the shortest scan time. Image contrast is determined by the effective inversion time ( TI eff ), which is the time between the 180-pulse and the central G z phase steps (i.e., k z near 0). MP-RAGE contrast is determined strongly by T1-contrast, but spin density and T2* effects are also present. Use of high bandwidth and short data collection period reduces susceptibility effects including eddy currents associated with metal. It is widely used in isotropic mode for T1-weighted brain imaging. MP-RAGE brain image with TR=2200, TI=1000, TE=3. MP2RAGE brain image with TR=4300, TI1=600, TI2=2000, TE=3. The MP2RAGE sequence , by comparison, uses two Turbo-FLASH GRE readouts between each inversion pulse. T he first inversion time ( TI 1 ) is typically about 700 ms, producing a T1-weighted image with the gray matter nulled at the center of k -space. The second inversion time ( TI 2 ) is long (~2500 ms), which combined with small flip angles (4-5) and long TR (~5000 ms), produces spin-density-weighted contrast. By combining image data from the 1st and 2nd readouts, T2* and B1 inhomogeneity effects can be largely cancelled out, resulting in a strongly T1-weighted image with superior gray matter to white matter contrast than available by MP-RAGE. Schematic of the MP2RAGE sequence (imaging gradients have been omitted for clarity). Unlike MP-RAGE data acquisition occurs in two separate readouts at different inversion times (TI 1 and TI 2 ). Each TI is defined as the time between the middle of the inversion pulse and the central echo of k -space.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mp-rage-v-mr2rage.html"}

When appropriate imaging parameters are used, GRE sequences generate a strong signal from moving spins, highlighting flowing blood or CSF. This property has made GRE-based sequences the backbone of most MR angiographic techniques. GRE sequences accentuate signals from flowing fluids for three principal reasons. First, when sequential mode acquisition (rather than interleaved multi-slice mode) is employed, each section behaves like an \"entry slice\" and demonstrates flow-related (inflow) enhancement. This statement is true for any flip angle, as long as the sequence is gradient- or RF-spoiled or the TR value is long enough to minimize steady-state effects. 3D spoiled GRE sequence (VIBE) shows inflow enhancement of arteries at the skull base For steady-state GRE sequences (e.g., GRASS/FISP), flow sensitivity can be increased by using moderate-to-large flip angles. Large flip angles accentuate the signal from flowing blood or CSF for two reasons: (1) they cause more saturation of stationary tissue, and when unsaturated spins flow in, a greater contrast between moving and static tissue can be appreciated; and (2) large flip angles produce signal intensity differences proportional to T2/T1, a ratio that is higher in CSF, blood, and other fluids than for solid tissues. The second factor increasing the flow sensitivity of GRE imaging concerns the nonselectivity of the GRE refocusing mechanism . In routine SE imaging, at least part of the reason for flow-related signal loss is that spins move out of the section between the 90- and 180-(refocusing)-pulses. In GRE imaging the refocusing is done by means of a gradient reversal that is not slice-selective. This nonselective refocusing does not result in hyperintensity of incoming spins, however; it merely prevents them from experiencing TOF signal losses. Finally, relatively short echo times ( TE's ) are often used in conjunction with GRE techniques to minimize T2*-dephasing. Because these short echo times also minimize flow-related signal losses, they accentuate the appearance of the flowing fluid.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-gre-uarr-flow-signal.html"}

Before diving into the details of how RF stimulation affects M , let us quickly review what M is and where the B 1 field comes from. Net magnetization (M), the averaged sum of many individual quantum spins, can be treated as a regular vector in classical physics. For the purposes of the next several Q&A's, it is probably better to forget completely about individual nuclear spins and consider only the net magnetization (M) , the sum of many spins averaged together. The bizarre aspects of quantum mechanics can then be disregarded and the motion of M analyzed using classical physics. Think of M as a big spinning bar magnet, if you must. The radiofrequency field (B 1 ) is applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field ( B o ). The B 1 field is produced either by a local coil (as shown in the picture) or more commonly, from windings in the walls of the scanner itself. Initially, M is aligned with B o but will be tipped out of alignment during application by the rotating/oscillating B 1 field. Like pushing a child on a swing, the B 1 field must be applied near the Larmor frequency for this to occur. With continued application of the B1 field, M precesses at continually larger angles away from Bo. Vertical bore scanner showing main (Bo) and RF (B1) fields. M is initially aligned with Bo but will be tipped away by the action of B1, precessing at the resonance frequency. Continued application of the B 1 field results in progressive tipping of the net magnetization away from its initial alignment with B o . M can be rotated 10, 90, 180, 270, 836, or any amount. After every 360 rotation M returns to its initial alignment with B o . Some progressive arbitrary rotations of M are shown below. The ambitious diagram below tries to represent what is happening to individual spins at the quantum level as well. Remember that in addition to M , each proton is also precessing around the B o field individually. From the Heisenberg uncertainty principle we cannot know the exact direction any particular proton magnetic moment is pointing at any given time. However, it can be shown that a homogenous B 1 field does not change the relative orientation of individual spins. The entire ensemble, like M , is merely rotated by the RF field. This is why the magnitude of the net magnetization ( M ) after an RF-pulse is the same as before an RF-pulse, although it is changed in direction. As long as the B1 field is left on, M can be rotated to any angle. However, neither the magnitude of M nor the relative orientation of spins changes during this rotation.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-does-b1-tip-m.html"}

Iodine-based radiographic contrast agents contain 127 I, the only stable isotope in nature. 127 I has a spin of 5/2, so it can undergo NMR if placed in a magnetic field. Its gyromagnetic ratio is approximately 8.52 MHz/T, meaning it resonates at about 1/5 the rate of an 1 H nucleus. 127 I also has a powerful quadrupolar moment, so its signal decays very quickly. In brief, an MR signal from iodine contrast could be recorded by a special laboratory NMR spectrometer, but would would not be detectable in a conventional MRI system. Gadolinium, like iodine, is a heavy metal capable of attenuating x-rays. The atomic number of gadolinium ( Z =64) is higher than that of iodine ( Z =53). The k -edge of gadolinium is also more closely matched to the peak of the CT spectrum, meaning gadolinium absorbs a greater fraction of the x-ray beam than does iodine. However, the lower concentration and total number of gadolinium atoms administered in current formulations means that gadolinium contrast has a much lower visibility on CT than iodine contrast. From the early 1990's to the mid-2000's, gadolinium contrast was occasionally used in CT and angiography in patients with severe allergies to iodinated contrast. An example from our institution is shown below.

Two types of image resolution are generally distinguished and tested: high-contrast and low-contrast. High-contrast resolution is the ability to detect finely spaced lines or holes with whose signals differ considerably from background. Low-contrast resolution is the ability to detect and discern objects with only subtle differences in signal intensity. Again, organizations like the American College of Radiology (ACR) and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) publish detailed procedures for measuring these properties. High Contrast Resolution Images of two high-contrast test objects. (Above) ACR phantom with hole arrays spaced at 1.1, 1.0, and 0.9 mm respectively.

The ACR phantom insert pictured above left has holes 0.9 - 1.1 mm diameter spaced 1.0 mm apart. When scanned with a technique having in-plane pixel size of 1 mm x 1 mm the holes in the middle set should all be resolved.

Parallel imaging is a widely used technique where the known placement and sensitivities of receiver coils are used to assist spatial localization of the MR signal. Having this additional information about the coils allows reduction in number of phase-encoding steps during image acquisition. This, in turn, potentially results in a several-fold reduction in imaging time. Although the details of how coil-specific data is translated into image information is somewhat complex, the basic idea underlying parallel imaging should not be. In fact, the core principle of parallel imaging is actually more easily grasped by most students than frequency- or phase-encoding. Consider, for example, a set of 4 receiver coils surrounding a head being used to detect the MR signal arising from a pixel as shown in the diagram left. Because each coil is at a different distance from the pixel, the signal recorded by each coil varies as a function of position (closer coils have stronger signals). Just by looking at the relative intensities from each coil, it is possible to make a crude prediction of the approximate source of the MR signal. Even without using phases, frequencies, or Fourier Transforms, we already know the signal is coming from somewhere in the left parietal lobe! Principle underlying parallel imaging: use coil sensitivity information to assist in spatial localization In \"regular\" (non-parallel) imaging, multiple surface coils may be used to detect the MR signal, but their individual outputs are combined into one aggregate complex signal that is digitized and processed into the final image. In parallel imaging, conversely, the signals from individual coils are amplified, digitized, and processed simultaneously \"in parallel\" along separate channels, retaining their identities until near the end. Parallel imaging has become practical in modern MRI because of advancements in telecommunications technology that have significantly reduced the cost of RF-digital processing systems. Today MR vendors offer commercial systems able to support 200+ coils and 128+ receiver channels.

The position of a peak along the NMR spectrum is constant and depends on its chemical shift () . As described in a prior Q&A , chemical shift is determined by the local molecular environment of the nucleus being imaged. The size and shape of a peak at a given spectral position is variable and depends on five major factors: (1) the concentration of nuclei giving rise to a particular line; ( 2) the T1 and T2 relaxation times of the metabolite, also affected by the TR and TE of the MRS sequence; (3) magnetic inhomogeneity across the sample, controlled by shimming; (4) the presence of hidden/overlapping peaks; and (5) whether the line is single or a multiplet. Concentration of Active Nuclei All other factors being equal, the relative sizes of two spectral lines reflect the concentration of nuclei giving rise to each peak. For example, a 1M sample of tetramethylsilane (Si(CH 3 ) 4 ) with 12 spectroscopically identical H atoms per molecule would theoretically produce a spectral line three times as large as a 1M sample of methane (CH 4 ) with only 4 H atoms per molecule . Thus peak heights do not reflect the molar concentration of metabolites per se, but the concentration of active nuclei in a those metabolites. Effects of T1 and T2 Relaxation Excluding macromolecules, most individual H metabolites have T1 and T2 values in the range of a few hundred to over 1000 msec, similar to relaxation times measured in whole organs. As with MR imaging, MR spectroscopy sequences contain operator-selectable parameters ( TR and TE ) that act together with T1 and T2 to affect the size and shape of spectral lines. TR controls T1 weighting. When TR is much shorter than the T1 of a metabolite, the longitudinal magnetization of that metabolite does not fully recover between excitations and its peak height will be reduced. Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of a spectral peak As with MR imaging, T2 determines the rate of decay of the spectroscopic signal. MRS sequences aquired at long TE's will have smaller peaks since more T2 decay has occurred. For a fixed TE , metabolites with shorter T2's will decay faster and have smaller peaks than those with longer T2's. T2 strongly affects the width of a spectral peak. The line width of a peak is defined by its Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM)  the width of the peak measured at 50% of its maximum height. Spectral peaks are generally considered to have Lorentzian line shapes, and under this condition in a homogenous field, the F WHM (in Hz) is proportional to ( 1/T2). Metabolites with long T2's will have narrow peaks while those with shorter T2's will be wider. Line Broadening by Inhomogeneity (T2*) Effects Reduced line widths with proper shimming In real life magnetic field inhomogeneities are always present, so the spectroscopic signal decays at the rate of T2* (which is always shorter than T2). These inhomogenety (T2*) effects broaden all spectral lines. That is why magnetic field shimming is essential before any spectroscopic measurements are made. Hidden/Overlapping Peaks Spectral lines of two different metabolites may be superimposed or overlap, producing what appears to be a single peak that is broader or taller than expected. Common examples include the overlap of lactate (  =1.33) and lipid (  =1.3) or NAA (  =2.01) and NAAG (  =2.04). Singlet vs Multiplet Peaks A final factor determining the appearance of peaks is whether they are split into two or more subpeaks, also known as multiplets . Splitting of spectral peaks results from an electron-mediated interaction of two nuclear spins residing on the same molecule. The phenomenon is known as J-coupling , whose mechanism is described more completely in the next Q&A . The take-home point that if a peak is split into multiplets by a J -coupling interaction, the overall complex of subpeaks will be smaller and broader than the original peak would have been without coupling.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/sizeshapes-of-peaks.html"}

In passive shimming small pieces of sheet metal or ferromagnetic pellets are affixed at various locations within the scanner bore to improve homogeneity. Conversely, active shimming uses currents directed through specialized coils to generate a \"corrective\" magnetic field. Active shim coils can be: 1) superconducting , located within the liquid helium-containing cryostat; or 2) resistive , mounted on the same support structure as the gradient coils within the room-temperature inner walls of the scanner. Both types of active shims require their own power supplies and are controlled by special circuitry. Some scanners use both types. Theory underlying active shimming. Unwanted harmonics in the inhomogeneous field are cancelled/neutralized by a shim component of equal and opposite polarity. The theory underlying all active shimming methods is based on spherical harmonic analysis, described in a previous question ( click here for link ). Field mapping first identifies various unwanted harmonic components in the inhomogeneous field. For each unwanted spherical harmonic component in the uncorrected magnetic field, a carefully controlled supplemental magnetic field is generated by passing current through an active shim gradient. This supplemental shim field has the same spatial distribution, but is equal and opposite to the unwanted component. By super-positioning and merging these two opposite magnetic fields together, a neutralization and cancellation of the magnetic field error (inhomogeneity) is effected. Superconducting shim coils are commonly encountered in magnets with fields of 3T or higher. Except for GE Healthcare, however, few manufacturers have used them in lower field strength scanners. Where present, superconducting shim coils (5-20 in number) are embedded in the cryostat just beyond the main coil windings and may correct for several orders of inhomogeneity. Each coil can be individually powered during the shimming process and has a switch allowing it to be placed in persistent superconducting mode once the desired field correction has been obtained. Unlike resistive shims, the current in superconducting shims and the magnetic fields they generate cannot be easily changed once set. Resistive shim coil tube from a 7T scanner. Resistive shimming relies on the passage of current through coils located near the room-temperature inner bore of the scanner. For first-order (linear) shimming, additional coils are not needed as the standard x -, y - and z -gradient coils used for imaging can double as shim coils. In a process known as gradient offset shimming the imaging gradients carry a small current (called the offset bias ), calculated to reduce residual linear inhomogeneities in the main magnetic field. This method is used in virtually all scanners. It saves space in the patient bore by removing the need for a separate set of first order shim coils. Some scanners also have additional resistive coils for higher-order shimming. Structurally, these are a series of individual wire windings or conductive patterns etched into copper sheets and formed onto a cylindrical surface. Usually they occupy the space between the primary and secondary gradient coils used for imaging and may be manufactured with the gradients as a single unit. A minimum of 5 separate coils are usually employed to obtain second order shimming; even more are needed for higher orders of field correction. In the classical shim coil arrangement, one coil is designed to correct each spherical harmonic. Axial coils (typically ring-shaped) correct harmonics in the z -direction (Z, Z2, Z3, etc). Transverse coils (often saddle shaped) correct more complex harmonics (XY, YZ, X2-Y2, ZXY, etc). This arrangement is not optimal in that neighboring windings often carry oppositely running currents. Newer matrix shim coil designs take this into account and are more efficient in reducing the number of windings required. The big advantage of resistive shims over passive and superconducting ones is that the currents through resistive shims can be changed dynamically. This allows shimming to be performed on a patient-by-patient basis. During the preparatory phase before routine MR scanning begins, rapid automated shimming is now performed routinely on many scanners. More detailed shimming using both automated and manual techniques is required when performing spectral fat suppression and MR spectroscopy.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/active-shimming.html"}

What is the difference between this and \"anaphylactic\"? The term anaphylaxis refers to an acute allergic reaction to a drug, food, or other foreign material (the allergen ). Clinical characteristics include involvement of the skin and mucosal tissues with hives or swelling, respiratory distress (dyspnea, bronchospasm), and/or circulatory disturbances (reduced blood pressure, syncope, cardiovascular collapse). \"True\" anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity reaction. Upon first exposure to the allergen (or a mimic antigen with similar molecular surface characteristics), lymphocytes are primed to to produce a specific IgE, but a systemic anaphylactic reaction does not occur. Upon second exposure, however, an amplified response occurs as IgE produced from the first round exposure attaches to the allergen as well as to specific (FcR1) surface receptors) on mast cells and basophils. This triggers calcium influx with degranulation and release of vasoactive amines (histamines, serotonin, tryptase) and inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, cytokines, IL4, and leukocyte chemotactic factors). True anaphylaxis involves an IgE intermediary with attachment to both antigen and mast cells causing release of vasoactive substances from granules. Anaphylactoid reactions have an identical clinical pattern to \"true\" anaphylaxis but are not IgE-mediated. Here allergens trigger the mast cells to release their granular contents into the circulation but without prior exposure or production of IgE. The allergen may activate mast cells directly or through a number of endogenous (non-IgE) intermediaries, including complement fragments C3a, C4a, C5a (also known as anaphylotoxins); substance P; angiotensin II; endorphins; eosinophilic proteins MBP and ECP; interleukins IL-1 and IL-3; and TNF. Of these, the complement-related pathways seem to be the most important for most pharmaceuticals including contrast agents. Because true anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reactions have the same clinical manifestations, sophisticated immunological testing is required (but seldom performed) to determine the exact nature of an allergic reaction to gadolinium. First exposure allergic reactions to gadolinium would seem statistically more likely to be anaphylactoid, but some first exposure IgE-mediated cases have been reported. Perhaps the only relevant feature of potential clincial importance is that anaphylactoid reactions are dose-related, whereas \"true\" anaphylaxis reactions are not. If a patient has had a previous mild reaction to a gadolinium contrast agent, in addition to premedication it is worthwhile considering reducing the dose and changing to a different agent. The lower dose strategy might reduce the risk of an anaphylactoid reaction (though it would have no effect on true anaphylaxis). Changing agents could conceivably reduce the risk of both types of reaction. As a final note, the term \"anaphylactoid\" is no longer widely used in current allergy/immunology literature, being replaced by the phrase \" non-IgE-mediated anaphylaxis \". I suspect the radiology community will eventually come around to this more modern nomenclature, but for now anaphylactoid remains ingrained in our literature.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/allergic-reactions.html"}
{"id": "96345308-01fb-49ec-b3d3-7c26a788dc73", "contents": "Diffusion Tensor What is the diffusion tensor? How is this different from \"regular\" diffusion? The diffusion tensor was briefly discussed in a previous Q&A where the concept of diffusion anisotropy was introduced. Biological tissues are highly anisotropic, meaning that their diffusion rates are not the same in every direction. For routine DW imaging we often ignore this complexity and reduce diffusion to a single average value, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) , but this is overly simplistic. Diffusion Tensor A superior method to model diffusion in complex materials is to use the diffusion tensor , a [3 x 3] array of numbers corresponding to diffusion rates in each combination of directions. The three diagonal elements ( D xx , D yy , D zz ) represent diffusion coefficients measured along each of the principal ( x-, y- and z -) laboratory axes. The six off-diagonal terms ( D xy , D yz , etc) reflect reflect the correlation of random motions between each pair of principal directions. For the special case of perfect isotropic diffusion (such as seen in pure liquids), the off-diagonal elements are all zero. The diagonal elements are all the same and equal the single diffusion coefficient, D , for the isotropic material (i.e., D xx = D yy = D zz = D ). For anisotropic diffusion , however, the diagonal elements are unequal and the off-diagonal elements cannot be ignored. An additional complicating factor is that the value of each tensor element depends upon the frame of reference in which it is measured. To measure these individual tensor elements we typically begin in the so-called laboratory ( x-y-z ) frame, which for clinical MRI is typically aligned with the patient's body and main magnetic field. Gradients are applied in different directions and several sets of raw data (source) images are obtained. After some filtering and other mathematical corrections, linear regression techniques are applied to the data to create estimates for each tensor component. Because xy and yx diffusivities should be the same, mirror-image off-diagonal elements are equal ( D xy = D yx , D yz = D zy , and D xz = D zx ). This means the diffusion tensor matrix is symmetric with only 6 unique elements. To estimate all of them we need a minimum of 7 measurements: one baseline ( b0 ) and 6 source data sets. The values we calculate for each tensor component (such as D xx or D xy ), however, are not unique, being dependent on the ( x-y-z ) frame of reference chosen for measurement. Had we selected a different coordinate system ( x'-y'-z' ) not aligned with the patient but at some arbitrary angle, the calculated values ( D x'x' or D x'y' ) would have been completely different. Fortunately an ideal frame of reference for viewing the diffusion tensor exists and can be determined using measurements obtained from any frame of reference. This optimal coordinate system is based upon the diffusion ellipsoid , whose main axis is parallel to the principal diffusion direction within a voxel. This principal axis often corresponds to anatomic features such as white matter tracts or fascial planes. The major and minor axes of the diffusion ellipsoid are defined by thee orthogonal unit vectors (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ) known as eigenvectors . The length of each eigenvector (  i ) is multiplied by a factor  i , called the eigenvalue . The eigenvalues of the ellipsoid are proportional to Einstein's root mean squared diffusion displacement in each direction. By convention, eigenvalues are labeled in descending order of magnitude (  1   2   3 ). Diffusion along a group of fiber tracts. In the laboratory frame of reference (x-y-z) we measure diffusion coefficients in 6 unique directional combinations described by the diffusion tensor, D . The measured values of each component depend on the frame of reference. A simpler frame of reference is to center the coordinate system in each voxel with axes parallel and tangent to the principal directions of diffusion (here along fiber bundles). This is commonly represented as an ellipsoid. The off-diagonal elements of the tensor disappear. The diffusion ellipsoid has three unit vectors, (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ) called eigenvectors, with corresponding lengths (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ), the eigenvalues. For perfect isotropic diffusion, the ellipsoid becomes a sphere with  1 =  2 =  3 . An additional benefit to using the diffusion ellipsoid is that in this frame of reference, the off-diagonal elements disappear. The set of eigenvalues define a matrix with only 3 diagonal elements denoted by the symbol  (\"capital lambda\") that appears in many advanced treatises about diffusion tensors. As a bonus, you may wish to watch this math professor explaining tensor and vectors. It's pretty good and only 12 minutes long.

Research magnet undergoing a quench with release of gaseous helium into the room A quench refers to the sudden loss of superconductivity when its temperature is raised. In the superconducting state, the resistance of the magnet coil windings is zero and hence no energy is required to maintain current flow. If the coil temperature rises above the superconductivity threshold ( T c ), the windings suddenly develop a finite resistance. The several-dozen amperes of circulating current passing through this elevated coil resistance create heat. This heat causes a sudden, explosive boil-off of liquid helium. I n my 30 years of clinical experience with MRI at one institution, I have observed several unexpected magnet quenches as well as a few planned quenches in conjunction with decommissioning older magnets. All occurred during installation or servicing when no patients were present. There were no injuries and most of the boiled off gases were vented safely outside the building. Here is my personal account of one such quench: The only warning of the impending quench was 5-10 seconds of a mild hissing sound caused by a small volume of helium escaping through the boil-off valve. Roaring or loud hissing then followed for about 20-30 seconds as great quantities of gaseous helium were released. As our facility was properly designed, nearly all of the released cryogens escaped through a vent tube to the rooftop, where a large cloud of vapors could be seen billowing into the sky. Although most of the gas was vented outside, some cryogens also escaped into the scanner room as well, filling it with a smoke-like mist. The cold vapors produced a marked chill in the air, with a sudden drop in room temperature by at least 10-15 degrees. Although gaseous helium is lighter than air and will float to the top of the room, large quantities can completely displace oxygen from the entire room and if inhaled may cause loss of consciousness within 10 seconds with the possibility of asphyxia and death. Patients and staff must therefore be evacuated immediately from the scanner room if a quench occurs. To my knowledge a quench-related death or serious injury has never been reported in a clinical MRI facility. Theoretically, the most dangerous situation would be if the quench tube became blocked or disconnected, allowing lethal quantities of helium to escape into the scanner room. This could increase pressure in the room making the door hard to open. In addition to asphyxiation, high concentrations of gaseous helium in this setting could cause thermal injury to eyes or skin. If electrical power is lost or the cryogen pump system goes down, MR magnets are sufficiently well insulated that they can go several days to a week without becoming warm enough to quench. This allows magnets to be pre-filled with liquid helium at the factory and \"cold-shipped\" to the receiving facility, thus reducing installation time. Quench tube from scanner (blue arrow) getting ready to be attached to vent in ceiling (green arrow) during magnet installation. Fortunately, with the new generation of sealed, low-volume helium scanners, sudden loss of superconductivity does not produce release of gas, and a quench tube for venting is not required.

Single-slice mode (Simple GRASS or FISP) When very short TR values are employed, it is usually possible to obtain only a single GRASS/FISP slice at a time. To cover a large area, therefore, a series of individual GRASS/FISP images must be acquired one by one. This technique is known as sequential multi-slice acquisition . In the sequential multi-slice mode, each slice is acquired independently and has signal characteristics as a function of TR , TE, and  as described for the idealized GRASS/FISP sequence in the prior Q&A . Furthermore, each slice can be considered an \"entry slice\" with respect to flow effects. Therefore, time-of-flight enhancement effects of blood or CSF are maximal when this mode of acquisition is used. Multi-slice Mode (Multi-section FISP, MPGR) When longer TR values are employed, it is possible to acquire several slices simultaneously within a single TR interval. This method is known as slice-interleaved or slice-multiplexed acquisition . In the slice-multiplexed mode, however, a significantly different contrast behavior occurs. Because multiple slices must be selected during each TR interval, a slice-selection gradient must be turned on for each slice imaged. These slice-select gradients spoil transverse coherences and convert the GRASS/FISP sequence to display spoiled-GRE contrast. Also in this mode, because only the end slices are true \"entry slices\", inflow enhancement effects are less pronounced. 2D vs 3D Implementations GRASS/FISP, as well as most other pulse sequences, can be operated in either 2D or 3D acquisition modes. A number of aspects of image contrast will differ depending on whether 2D or 3D is chosen. One immediately noticeable effect is the appearance of blood vessels. In the 2D single-slice mode, GRASS/FISP sequences typically demonstrate marked flow-related enhancement of blood and spinal fluid flowing into each slice. This inflow effect, moderately muted in the 2D multi-slice mode, is even further reduced in 3D acquisitions. Overall image contrast may also vary among different parts of a 3D volume. This results from difficulty in obtaining a uniform RF-flip angle throughout the entire volume. As the flip angle varies, so does image contrast.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/grass-vs-mpgr.html"}

What you are referring to is Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS), the excitation of nerves in the extremities from electrical voltage potentials induced by rapidly changing magnetic gradients. When mild, PNS may be perceived as a tingling or tapping sensation, often surprising the patient but presenting no real discomfort or physical danger. As stimulation intensity increases, motor nerve depolarization produces progressively severe and painful muscle fasciculations/contractions. In animal models, excitation of cardiac Purkinje fibers with arrhythmias can occur at very high exposure levels (far beyond what humans would experience in the current generation of MR scanners). According to Faraday's Law , the intensity of the electric field ( E ) producing nerve or muscle depolarization is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic gradient field ( dB/dt ). As shown in the diagram below, dB/dt (and hence E ) are maximized during the ramp up and ramp down portions of the gradient waveform. PNS therefore typically occurs in pulse sequences using rapid gradient switching, such as echo planar, turbo-SE, or SSFP techniques. It should be recognized that the largest gradient fields may occur outside the field-of-view since only the most linear central segments are used for imaging. Additionally, one must add contributions from all three gradients ( x -, y -, and z -) to determine the full effect. The strongest induced E fields are typically located in the more superficial portions of the patient where many peripheral nerves run. E fields are also concentrated where tissues of different conductivity (such as bone, fat, and muscle) are juxtaposed or in the vicinity of metallic implants. Peak dB/dt (and hence E ) values occur during gradient ramp up and ramp down periods. Circulating tissue currents reverse when dB/dt is negative. Stimulus duration ( t stim ) is the sum of the times corresponding to the 3 red blocks above. The strongest gradients may occur outside the imaged field-of-view. Simulated distribution of x-direction magnetic gradient ( B ) and and gradient switching-induced electric ( E ) fields in a human subject. Note the gradient ( B ) fields are strongest near the walls of the scanner (immediately adjacent to the coils). The E fields in the patient are concentrated superficially and accentuated at the junction of bones, fat, and muscle (which have different electrical conductivities). [Images courtesy of Valerie Klein] Depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers depends on the intensity of the stimulus and the length of time it is applied, represented graphically by the strength-duration curve . The strength and duration are inversely related, producing a hyperbolic-shaped curve whose precise dimensions depend on the tissue being stimulated (nerve vs muscle) as well as how the stimulus is applied (unipolar vs bipolar excitation, rapidity of switching, etc.) Representative strength-duration curve for peripheral nerve, representing electrical threshold for stimulation ( E TH ). Chronaxie and rheobase definitions are illustrated. Because of this inverse relationship, a weak stimulus must be applied for a longer period of time to achieve excitation. The rheobase represents the minimum stimulus required for excitation, while the chronaxie is the required time for a depolarizing stimulus applied at twice the rheobase value. Based on studies in human volunteers scanned in whole-body cylindrical magnets using trapezoidal gradients with various ramp times ( t stim ), the chronaxie for peripheral nerve stimulation is approximately 0.36 ms corresponding to a rheobase of about 2.2 V/m or 20 T/s (expressed in E and dB/dt units respectively). Larger axons are more easily depolarized than smaller ones, as are those with anatomic turns and kinks (where current densities may be concentrated). Cardiac muscle contraction requires levels of simulation at least 10-100 times higher than PNS. Thus a subject accidentally exposed to very high levels of dB/dt would most certainly experience warning peripheral nerve stimulation before reaching levels risking the heart.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts , used primarily for treatment of hydrocephalus, are among the most commonly implanted neurosurgical devices. The typical shunt consists of 3 components  (1) a silastic catheter placed through a burr hole into a ventrical to suction out CSF, (2) a subcutaneous one-way valve mechanism for directing flow, and 3) a distal catheter to transport CSF to a distal absorption site. The distal site is typically the peritoneal cavity, but can be the pleural space, heart (right atrium), or central venous system. X-ray of a patient with a Codman-Hakim ventriculoperitoneal shunt with SiphonGuard antigravity device and reservoir. Scaled-to-size photos of the actual equipment are superimposed on the radiograph. In addition to these basic components, shunt systems may also incorporate a subcutaneous reservoir or antechamber with a silicone elastomer dome that can be manually pumped to test for shunt patency or used for needle aspiration/injection. Many systems also include an anti-siphon or \"anti-gravity\" device to reduce excess flow of CSF when the patient assumes the upright posture. About a half dozen companies manufacture shunt tubing, valves, and accessories world-wide, including: AESCULAP-MIETHKE (m.blue, ProGAV, proSA, SHUNTASSISTANT), Integra (CODMAN-HAKIM, CODMAN CERTAS, OSV II); Medtronic (PS Medical, Strata II); Natus (Natus DP, Novus, Contour-Flex, Ultra VS, Pudenz); and SOPHYSA (Polaris, Sophy Mini, Siphonx) The shunt valve is the critical component of the system with many variations and designs available. The simplest type is a fixed pressure valve that opens only when a single predetermined CSF pressure differential is exceeded. These valves may operate via deflection of a silicone membrane (diaphragm) and be incorporated into the base of a reservoir. A second common design is a movable ball held in place by a compression spring, whose elasticity determines the valve's opening pressure. The major disadvantage of fixed pressure valves is that a single specific pressure must be chosen before surgery. Programmable (adjustable) valves allow opening pressures to be changed non-invasively. In addition to a ball and spring inlet valve, a separate magnetically-activated mechanism allows additional incremental pressure regulation in typical increments of 10-20 mm H 2 O. The design of the programmable component varies by manufacturer. The Integra Codman-Hakim Valve uses a \"stepping motor\"  a rotating disk embedded with 10 permanent micro-magnets that can be raised or lowered along a spiral plastic staircase using an external magnetic programmer. The Sophysa Polaris system operates through a modified spring/ball mechanism whose tension is controlled by the position of a rotating bar containing two small magnets. After programming, the pressure set for of each valve can be determined by a magnetic compass or the position of radio-opaque markers on x-ray (dependent on the model). External programmer device for the Codman-Hakim shunt X-ray template to verify valve setting for a Codman-Hakim shunt, here found to be ~80 mm H 2 O Several other related drainage devices should be mentioned here: Extraventricular drains (EVDs) are catheters that divert CSF from the ventricle to a sterile container outside the patient. The line may or may not contain an anti-reflux valve. EVDs are used for temporary relief of acute hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure when long-term therapy with a shunt is not anticipated. The CSF collection container is raised or lowered on an IV pole to control/measure intracranial pressure and CSF flow. If a patient with an EVD is brought into the MRI suite for scanning, make sure the IV pole is replaced by an MR-compatible one! Also, some systems have small leveling lasers that should also be removed. Lumbar shunts and drains are similar to ventricular shunts and EVDs except they siphon CSF from the spinal canal (into the peritoneal cavity or into an external system respectively). Non-shunt reservoir systems consist of only a ventricular catheter and reservoir, often manufactured as a single piece. No shunt valve or distal components are present. These systems are primarily used to deliver intraventricular chemotherapy for cancer or infection and to allow intermittent sampling of CSF. Commonly used models include Rickham, Ommaya, and Holter reservoirs. Depending on their composition, they are either MR Safe or MR Conditional . Subdural Evacuating Port System (SEPS )  is a device made by Medtronic used for the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas. A bolt-like evacuating port made of stainless steel is screwed into a skull burr hole that communicates with the subdural space while the other end is connected to silicone tubing and a plastic suction bulb. The manufacturer has declared SEPS to be MR Unsafe (but it is unclear to me how the risk of such a device is greater than that of standard bolts, most of which are MR Conditional .) MRI Safety Considerations Many fixed pressure valve shunt systems and reservoirs are entirely made of non-metallic components and are thus MR Safe . The shunt tubing is made radio-opaque by embedded barium, so is also safe at all field strengths. Shunt connectors are typically made of titanium, making them (trivially) MR Conditional . Fixed valves containing springs are all rated MR Conditional up to 3.0T, but the springs are typically made of 316 nonferromagnetic stainless steel that produce only a small artifact. Programmable valves all contain small magnets in addition to springs and other components made of 316 stainless steel, titanium, or tantalum. These will definitely produce moderately large susceptibility artifacts and potentially be affected by the magnetic field. All currently produced programmable shunt systems including anti-siphon devices are considered MR Conditional up to 3.0T. In addition to exposure to MRI fields, patients are warned that devices such as cellphones and headphones be kept at least 5 cm (2\") from the valve mechanism. The main risk of MRI is unintentional resetting of the valve pressure. First generation programmable valves (Codman Medos, Medtronic Strata and Sophysa Sophy valves) have no locking mechanism to prevent changes in the shunt settings by external magnets. Accordingly, these older valves are at risk of being reprogrammed during MR imaging and the change in pressure setting may be substantial. For these valves or unknown valve types we recommend their pressures interrogated within 4 hours after MRI exposure to assure that the valve setting has not changed. Second generation programmable valves (e.g. Codman Certas , Sophysa Polaris, and Miethke proGAV) have internal locking mechanisms that minimize pressure changes from external magnetic fields. These valves have proved highly resistant to setting changes in MRI scanners up to 3.0T. Accordingly, a more leisurely approach to rechecking valve pressures (on the order of days rather than hours) may be indicated provided no clinical symptoms of shunt dysfunction are present.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/shuntsdrains.html"}

Can you help? Note to reader: Please make sure you understand the 2-pixel phase-encoding example in the last Q&A before proceeding on to this more complicated example. We expand our previous 2-pixel Q&A example to a 6-pixel one, showing how Fourier transformation is used to sort out overlapping signal contributions in two dimensions. Below is a 2x3 array of pixels (A-F) at the center of a brain image with frequency- and phase-encoding directions as designated. In this simple experiment we again play out only two phase-encoding steps. In Step 0 the PE gradient is off and the signals from all pixels remain in phase. In Step 2 we assume the pixels in the second row (B, D, and F) all acquire a phase shift of 180 relative to row 1. After each phase-encoding step, a single aggregate MR signal is recorded reflecting contributions from each of the six pixels. Hence in this simple example with only two phase-encoding steps, exactly 2 MR signals are recorded from the slice. For a real-life MR image, the process described in the 6-pixel example is repeated using 128-256+ phase-encoding steps. The simultaneous solution of multiple equations is not quite so straightforward but can still be accomplished by advanced mathematical techniques. (Note that here the phase-encoding direction is left-to-right). The first of these signals is acquired when there is no phase shift between the two rows. Fourier transformation of this MR signal generates a spectrum revealing three frequencies (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ), whose amplitudes ( A+B ), ( C+D ), and ( E+F ) are the sum of the pixel values in each frequency column. At this stage we only know the sums of the pixel values for each frequency column; we do not know the individual values for any cell. When we record the MR signal from the whole sample after Step 1 (where the second row has been phase-shifted by 180, the Fourier spectrum has changed. Again three frequencies can be separated, but this time their magnitudes are ( AB ), ( CD ), and ( EF ). We still are not able to assign unique pixel values with this single measurement, because now only the differences in pixel values for each frequency column are known. Because the Fourier Transform has sorted out frequencies into three columns, the corresponding phase change information can now be decoded. As in the 2-pixel example, and algebraic manipulation of the data for each frequency column using data from each phase-shift allows us to determine A, B, C, D, E , and F uniquely. A real MR image may have hundreds of pixels in each dimension, and hence requires hundreds of phase-encoding steps to decode, but the basic principles are the same.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/pe-and-fe-together.html"}

Before reading this section you should be aware that there is no universally accepted method to measure the MR signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) applicable to all situations. Both the \"signal\" and the \"noise\" must be measured, but that is not as easy to accomplish as one might imagine! Nature and Characteristics of Noise For quality control purposes, we are concerned with random (background) noise , primarily thermal in nature, arising from radiofrequency coil resistance, electronic noise in the preamplifier, and dielectric and inductive losses in the imaged object. Random background noise should be distinguished from structured noise, such as that arising from ghosting, motion, filtering, and reconstruction. Structured noise is certainly important, particularly for SNR in living subjects, but is not the focus of this Q&A. He we will restrict our analysis to measurements of signal and noise in and around a uniform phantom obtained from a 2D spin-echo pulse sequence. Experimental evidence supports the concept that random MR noise can be considered \"white\" (distributed equally across all frequencies) with an amplitude distribution that is approximately Gaussian. Distribution of noise pixels under various conditions Because region-of-interest (ROI) measurements are typically made on magnitude-reconstructed images, some correction to the statistics must take place. Recall that \"raw\" MR data is a complex number with real and imaginary parts. When converted to a magnitude only image, the pixel values corresponding to noise are no longer Gaussian, but skewed into a so-called Rician distribution . Fortunately, some simplification of the noise statistics occurs in two locations: a) in the center of the phantom where the SNR is intrinsically high, the noise can again be considered Gaussian; and b) in the air outside the phantom where the the pixel distribution follows the Rayleigh distribution , whose standard deviation is related to the standard deviation of the original Gaussian by a factor of  ( 2/2 )  0.66. Methods for Measuring SNR with Phantoms The National Manufacturers Electrical Association (NEMA) provides several methods for measuring the SNR in a phantom, two of which are most commonly used. A uniform phantom with regions of interest identified for measuring signal (S) and noise (N) In the first method pictured right, a circular ROI to measure mean signal ( S ) is chosen that incorporates most of the phantom (but avoiding the edges). Random noise ( N ) is measured as the average standard deviation of pixel intensity from air from four square ROIs located at the corners of the image. (The location of these ROIs is to avoid structured noise from the phantom propagated along the phase and frequency axes). The measured SNR = S/N must then be multiplied by the 0.66 Rayleigh distribution correction factor to calculate the true SNR. If more than one receive coil is used for data collection, an additional correction factor of up to 8% (depending on number of coils) may also need to be applied. A second NEMA method measures noise statistics within the phantom itself. A circular central ROI is defined as before. Two images are then obtained in the same location in rapid succession. Signal ( S ) is the mean pixel value within the ROI of these first two images. The two images are then subtracted from one another and the difference data analyzed. Ideally the proton signal from the phantom itself would be eliminated leaving only noise behind. The standard deviation of pixel values within the ROI of the subtracted image is an estimate of the random noise (assumed to be Gaussian). But because this calculation involves a difference operation, the true SNR must be corrected by a factor of 1/  2  0.71. An additional multi-receive coil correction may also be necessary as in the first method.

This is a direct consequence of the fact that the primary purpose of PI techniques is to reduce imaging time. In so doing, fewer data points are acquired and averaged, so the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) correspondingly decreases. The SNR of PI sequences is therefore always lower than that of equivalent non-PI sequences. The SNR of PI sequences are affected by all of the same factors that affect non-PI sequences: field strength, magnet hardware, coil loading, tissue imaged, pulse sequence, pulse sequence timing parameters, voxel volume, number of phase-encoding steps, receiver bandwidth, number of signals averaged, etc. Additionally, the SNR for PI sequences ( SNR parallel ) are further reduced by two additional factors as reflected in the equation below where R is the parallel imaging reduction or acceleration factor and g is a spatially dependent term called the geometry factor . The  R term represents the expected SNR loss resulting from reducing scan time by a factor of R. Since only 1/R of the k -space lines are sampled, this term has the similar effect to reducing the number of phase encoding steps or signal averages would have on SNR for a non-PI sequence. Hence, selecting R=2 reduces imaging time by 1/2 and decreases SNR by 1/2  0.71. The significant impairment of SNR is seen in the images below, where R is increased from 1 to 3 to 6. No acceleration (R=1) Acceleration factor R=3 Acceleration factor R=6 SENSE knee MRI with R=4. Note non-uniform distribution of noise across the image related to a spatially varying g -factor. The geometry factor, g , is more interesting, and unique to PI. It depends on the number of aliased replicates for each point and their associated differences in coil sensitivities. The g -factor is not a constant, but varies by location across the image. With typical coil designs in common use, g-factors ranging from 1.0 to 2.0 across the imaging volume are common. The g -factor thus depends on 1) number and location of surface coils, 2) coil loading, 3) plane of imaging, 4) direction of phase-encoding within the scan plane, and 5) voxel location within the imaged region. It relates to the number, size, orientation of surface coil elements and can be thought of as a measure of coil separation. It is also sometimes called the \" noise amplification factor .\"", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/noise-in-pi.html"}

For routine abdominal imaging, we seldom use any type of enteric contrast agent. However, we regularly use orally administered contrast when intrinsic diseases of the bowel wall or mesentery are evaluated, as for MR enterography . The goal of all such agents is to distend collapsed loops of bowel while replacing ingested food and air by a material with a uniform consistency. Enteric MR contrast materials are often classified by their effects on the signal of bowel contents. Biphasic contrast agents lengthen both T1 and T2 values, resulting in decreased intraluminal signal on T1 weighted images and increased signal on T2-weighted images. Water is the simplest example of a biphasic agent. Positive contrast agents shorten T1 relaxation times and increase intraluminal signal on T1-weighted images. Negative contrast agents shorten T2 relaxation times and decrease intraluminal signal on T2-weighted images. Positive and negative contrast agents typically utilize paramagnetic or diamagnetic materials to create these effects. Biphasic contrast agents are all water-based, appearing dark on T1-weighted and bright on T2-weighted images. Although in large quantities pure water provides good distention of the stomach and duodenum, it is resorbed rapidly in the jejunum making it an inadequate contrast agent for most small bowel imaging. To overcome this limitation, biphasic enteric contrast agents contain nonabsorbable additives (resins, polyethylene glycol, mannitol, sorbitol, or other sugar alcohols) that help draw in and retain intraluminal water. Although many \"make your own\" recipes are available, we prefer to use a commercially available product ( NeuLumEX  , formerly VoLumen  , Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) , already approved and widely used for CT enterography. A similar product ( Breeza Beekley Medical, Bristol, CT) is a well-tolerated alternative, being marketed as a flavored beverage. MR enterography with VoLumen NeuLumEX  is a thin (0.1% w/v) barium sulfate solution with a blueberry flavoring. It contains 1.4% sorbitol as well as gum resins and barium that contribute to water retention by its hyperosmolar nature. These benefits for imaging also create problems for the patient; many complain of severe abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after consuming this material. Before imaging, patients are asked to drink approximately 1 L of VoLumen over a 30-45 minute period. They may also be given 10 mg of metoclopramide (to promote gastric emptying) and 0.5 mg of glucagon IV (to reduce peristalsis). Increased water within the bowel means that the intraluminal contents will have long T1 and T2 values. In MR enterography T2-weighted ultrafast breath-hold sequences like HASTE or TrueFISP are are typically used rendering the intestinal contents bright and their walls dark. Positive contrast agents shorten relaxation times and increase intraluminal signal on T1-weighted images. This is usually accomplished using low concentrations of ferric, manganese, or gadolinium ions. In the 1990's several of these agents were commercially available, including an enteral formulation of Magnevist (Gd-DTPA) and LumenHance (MnCl 2 ). Neither agent is still in production. Some researchers have recommended the use of blueberry or pineapple juice as positive contrast agents, since both contain naturally high levels of manganese. In a different strategy, orally administered lipids with short T1 values (e.g., mineral oils, emulsions, and sucrose polyesters) have also been evaluated as positive contrast agents. Negative contrast agents are designed to make the intraluminal contents dark, especially on T2-weighted images. This can be done by filling the bowel with diamagnetic materials (barium, kaolin) or relatively high concentrations of paramagnetic ions (where very short T2 values dominate the effects of short T1s). The use of perfluorochemicals (molecules where H atoms are replaced by F atoms) at one time seemed promising, giving rise to a now discontinued product (Imagent GI). At present the most popular negative enteric agents use superparamagnetic ion oxides (SPIOs) to produce marked T2* shortening. GastroMARK (ferumoxsil) is such a product  an oral suspension of siloxane-coated magnetite nanoparticles. GastroMARK causes a remarkable drop in signal within the bowel lumen on both T1 and T2-weighted images. The darkening on T1-weighted images allows visualization of mucosal enhancement. Some centers mix NeuLumEX  and GastroMARK  as a combined agent. Like VoLumen  , GastroMARK  also causes abdominal pain and diarrhea in up to 30% of patients. And, as a bonus, it tastes terrible!

Once the magnet is sited in the imaging suite, its field will be further distorted by the presence of metal in pipes, wires, ducts, and structural beams in the immediate environment. Fringe fields of nearby scanners may also affect the field of the newly installed magnet. Shimming is the process by which the main magnetic field ( B o ) is made more homogenous. Shimming may be passive, active, or both. In passive shimming small pieces of sheet metal or ferromagnetic pellets are affixed at various locations within the scanner bore.

Balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) techniques based on TrueFISP (FIESTA) sequences are widely used for noncontrast MRA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. TrueFISP/FIESTA are rapid gradient-echo sequences in which the free induction decay (FID) and spin/stimulated echo components are made to coincide in the middle of the TR interval. As described in a prior Q&A , this structure allows a coherent transverse steady state to become established, whose maximum signal intensity depends on the ratio T2/T1 of the tissue being imaged. Approximate T2/T1 ratios at 1.5T b-SSFP MRA exploits the differences between the relatively high T2/T1 ratio of blood compared to most other tissues. As seen in the table left, most solid tissues have low T2/T1 ratios, on the order of 0.050.10 at 1.5T. Blood, fat, and pure fluids have much higher T2/T1 values and therefore appear intrinsically bright on SSFP sequences. An important concept is that image contrast in b-SSFP MRA sequences derives principally from the relaxation properties of blood itself. The appearance of vessels is relatively insensitive to a wide range of blood velocities, direction of flow, or phase of the cardiac cycle. Because of their gradient symmetry, b-SSFP sequences are intrinsically flow-compensated in all three directions. Some signal loss on SSFP MRA does occur with high degrees of turbulence or rapid jets across stenotic lesions, but these phenomena can be useful to identify and assess the significance of such abnormalities. Because both fat and fluids also have high T2/T1 ratios, their presence next to blood vessels may compromise the quality of a b-SSFP MRA study. In fact, the b-SSFP method is not suitable for intracranial MRA where vessels normally reside in a bath of high-signal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Small vessels such as the coronary, renal, or mesenteric arteries may also be obscured by high signal from the nearby fat in which they are embedded. Commonly an adjuvant fat suppression method is used when performing b-SSFP MRA of these vessels. Left: SSFP (TrueFISP) thoracic aortogram Above: Gated SSFP (TrueFISP) coronary artery image with fat suppression Intrinsic high signal of adjacent veins may not be a problem for b-SSFP imaging of large structures like the cardiac chambers or the thoracic aorta, but can create problems in visualizing smaller vessels such as the renal arteries where veins are in close proximity. A variety of inversion recovery-based saturation methods are commonly used to suppress venous inflow, enhance arterial inflow, or both. These will be described in subsequent Q&A's. Cardiac-gated, cine b-SSFP-MRA is the principal technique used for functional cardiac imaging to assess chamber size, wall motion abnormalities, regurgitation, shunting, and cardiac output. These methods will be described in detail in the Cardiac MR Tab following the current one. The major limitation of balanced SSFP-MRA is its sensitivity to field inhomogeneities, with the occurrence of zebra-stripe (Moir) artifacts especially near the edges of the image. Anatomic distortions may occur at air-tissue interfaces or in the presence of nearby metallic foreign bodies, especially surgical clips and stents. Although additional localized shimming prior to imaging is may reduce these artifacts, they often cannot be eliminated. b-SSFP zebra-stripe phase artifacts (arrow) Flow artifacts in descending aorta on b-SSFP SSFP techniques also suffer due to signal contributions from flowing spins that have already exited the imaging slice. Gradient activity in SSFP in not confined to the region of the RF-excitations. The balanced nature of these gradients permits out-of-slice transverse magnetization to contribute to the total SSFP signal. This results in broadening of slice thickness for flowing spins, frequency dependence of flow-related enhancement, and increased flow-related artifacts.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ssfp-mra.html"}

All available evidence suggests that gadolinium-based contrast agents are well tolerated in infants and children and may provide useful radiologic information in selected cases. The risk of an adverse drug reaction is apparently no higher or lower in the pediatric population than in adults. In the last several years considerable attention has been directed toward the potential cellular toxicity of gadolinium and its role in the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) . In a recent review 23 children were identified in the United States between 1997 and 2012 with proof of this disease. All had significant renal impairment or were on dialysis. Nearly all were teenagers or adolescents; the four youngest were between 6 and 9 years old. Seventeen (74%) patients had documented exposure to gadolinium contrast, predominantly gadodiamide. Of note, no gadolinium exposure could be demonstrated in 6 of the patients. Appropriate use of Gd in newborn with congenital brain tumor. Because of potential cellular toxicity and unknown effects, I personally recommend the use of gadolinium contrast only sparingly in infants and young children and restrict its use to cases when a reasonable diagnostic benefit seems likely. Most frequently this includes those with suspected tumor or infection. Because some amount of free gadolinium is likely leaked into tissues by all contrast agents, it seems reasonable to recommend Dotarem in infants and children because it possesses the strongest gadolinium binding of all commercially available agents. Since the biological half-life of these agents may be prolonged in premature infants due to their naturally lower glomerular filtration rates (GFRs), a theoretical risk of increased exposure to free gadolinium may be present in this subgroup.

Several professional societies, including the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS, 2017) and the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM, 2020) , have addressed this issue through expert consensus statements and suggested protocols. Even the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS, 2018) have weighed in and provided recommendations and requirements for coverage for these patients. Essentially the same procedures described in the prior Q&A for MR Conditional CIEDs should be followed for non-conditional ones. A few points of emphasis should perhaps be added: Explaining the risks and benefits to the patient should not be abbreviated and be thoroughly documented in the medical records. Although research supports that such scans can be done safely, I personally believe non-conditional CIED patients are assuming a slightly greater risk. This is especially true for pacemaker-dependent patients. Equipment and protocols: I'd recommend staying at 1.5T, Normal Operating Mode, and keeping SAR levels as low as possible. Be particularly aware that if the non-conditional device contains a reed switch , it will likely close during when placed in the magnetic field, and then may open and close unpredictably. The device should be reprogrammed to exclude action of the reed switch prior to scanning. If you are in the USA and want to be paid for your work by Medicare/Medicaid, you must follow their rules explicitly.

Centrally within the lumen, blood flow will be most rapid; peak velocity often exceeds the average velocity by 50%. Instantaneous blood flow at a given point in a vessel will also depend upon the phase of the cardiac cycle in which it is measured.

In their famous experiments of 1946, Bloch, Purcell, and colleagues employed a continuous wave (CW) technique using a fixed frequency RF field ( B 1 ) while the main magnetic field ( B o ) was swept through resonance. They observed transient fluctuations in coil voltage referred to as \"resonance absorption\" by Purcell and the \"nuclear induction signal\" by Bloch. Two years later, Bloembergen, Purcell, and Pound noted that immediately after the system had passed through resonance, small oscillations appeared on either side of the main absorption tracing that were named the \"wiggles\". About the same time, Erwin Hahn, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana, was investigating pulsed NMR techniques. In pulsed methods the main magnetic field is held constant while an RF-field at the Larmor frequency is pulsed on and off. Immediately after the RF pulse Hahn observed a transient oscillation he recognized was equivalent to Bloembergen's \"wiggles\". Hahn called this signal the \"nuclear induction decay\" or \"free induction,\" which today is commonly referred to as the free induction decay (FID) . As described in a previous Q&A the nuclear induction signal arises as the net magnetization ( M ) vector precesses around the z -axis (the direction of B o ). The transverse components of M generate a current in the receiver coil based on the Faraday-Lenz Law of electromagnetism. The signal is a sine wave oscillating at the Larmor frequency ( o ). The NMR signal, however, does not persist forever. The initially coherent transverse components of M dephase as a result of both magnetic field inhomogeneities and intrinsic T2 mechanisms, incorporated in the concept of T2*-decay . The resulting signal is the FID, a damped sine wave of the following form [ sin  o t ] e -t/T2* Actual FID recorded from my 1.5T scanner. The individual 64 MHz oscillations are too fast to resolve on this time scale. Although it is convenient to think about an FID arising from the action of a 90 pulse, an FID will be created by an RF pulse of any flip angle because some component of longitudinal magnetization is always tipped into the transverse plane. (The only theoretical exception to this rule might be a 180 pulse, which in principle should only invert the longitudinal magnetization and not generate any transverse components. In practice, however, all 180 pulses are imperfect, and therefore always produce FID signals.) The FID is just one of four basic types of NMR signals produced in different ways.

A large portion of cardiology practice involves the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) . Acute myocardial infarction produces myocardial edema, manifest by increased free water content with significantly prolonged T2 values. T2-weighted MR imaging has been shown to help differentiate ACS from remote infarction and non-ACS causes of chest pain. Although controversy exists, many consider T2-hyperintense regions to delineate an \"area at risk\" for ischemic myocardial injury. In conjunction with late gadolinium enhancement, T2-based images may be used to quantify myocardial salvage and the success of coronary revascularization surgery. Prolonged T2, however, is not specific for acute myocardial infarction. It can be seen in chronic infarction as well as acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathies, myocardial contusion, transplant rejection, sarcoidosis, and various infiltrative diseases. Conversely, short T2 areas (dark on T2-weighted images) may indicate myocardial hemorrhage and areas of microvascular obstruction within an infarct. These features have been associated with poor LV remodeling and worse clinical outcomes. Several pulse sequences are available for T2-weighted imaging. The oldest are fast (turbo) spin-echo sequences with long TR's/ TE's . These are typically preceded by an inversion module to suppress blood ( double inversion recovery, DIR ) and/or fat ( triple inversion recovery, TIR ). The latter method has contrast features similar to short- TI inversion recovery (STIR) imaging in that T1- and T2- signal contributions are additive. Septal edema on STIR in patient with recent acut e myocardial infarction Although dozens of T2 mapping sequences have been developed at research sites, the most widely used worldwide are those which are commercially available. These are all 2D include: single-shot T2-prepared bSSFP or T2p-GRE, multi-echo fast spin echo (multi-echo FSE), and gradient spin echo (GraSE). The first two have been recommended by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance. Assessment of T2 hyperintensities are by nature subjective, and MR artifacts may both mimic or obscure true abnormalities. Such artifacts include: 1) surface coil nonuniformities creating variable T2 signal across the myocardium; 2) bright subendocardial rims on DIR/TIR due to stagnant blood; and 3) loss of signal from the posterior wall due to cardiac movement. To overcome some of these difficulties and allow more consistency of diagnosis, T2-mapping has been recommended. T2-mapping is typically performed using a balanced SSFP readout sequence preceded by a multinomial T2-preparation module. Signals are sampled at several different TE's and fitted to an exponential decay curve of the form: S i = M o e TE i / T2 to determine T2. The results are displayed on a pixel-by-pixel base in a color map, from which T2-values can be directly measured. At 1.5T the T2 of the normal heart is approximately 45-55 ms. Exact threshold values for edema detection have not been firmly established, but those  70 ms are generally considered abnormal.

Note: In this Q&A we adopt the convention that substances \"bright\" on T1-weighed images have short T1 values. This is true for most (but not all) pulse sequences. For a detailed explanation, click here . I know that cholesterol is mentioned in the vast majority of MR books, papers, and websites as a cause for high signal on T1-weighted images. Although there may be some occasional situations where this occurs, for the most part other explanations are more reasonable. I believe that on the whole T1 brightening due to cholesterol has been far overstated. To justify my claim, a short overview is required. Cholesterol is an organic lipid that serves as an important structural component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones, bile acids, and vitamin D. It is found ubiquitously throughout the body, with higher concentrations in blood, fat, liver, and adrenals. Its concentration in adipose tissue is small (only 1mg/g) and outnumbered a thousand-fold by other triglycerides. Nevertheless, fat constitutes one of the body's largest cholesterol pools where it is stored in the central oil droplet of the adipocyte. The deposition of cholesterol in the walls of vessels has been a topic of extensive scientific investigation over the last several decades. As such, a wealth of MRI and MRS data concerning cholesterol derives directly from research on atherosclerotic plaques. This body of knowledge reveals that cholesterol exists in several forms and states, each with different imaging characteristics. At body temperatures, atherosclerotic plaque lipids are simultaneously present in an isotropic liquid state (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides), liquid crystalline state (phospholipid/cholesterol bilayers), and solid state (cholesterol crystals). The narrow-line MRS signals from plaque arise predominantly from the liquid lipid phase (mostly cholesterol esters). Cholesterol in all its states has a short T1 value and range of chemical shifts similar to other lipids. The T2 values of cholesterol, however, differ significantly according to state. Liquid cholesterol esters have fairly short T2 values (~5-10 msec), but these times are long enough to be detectable/imageable by routine MRI. By contrast, the solid and crystalline forms of cholesterol associated with cell membranes have extremely short T2 times (measured in microseconds); their signals decay too quickly for detection using routine MR techniques. This lipid- and cholesterol-laden aortic plaque is not particularly bright on the T1-weighted image. Cholesterol-containing atheromatous plaques . The earliest MR investigations into the imaging of atherosclerotic plaque were focused on detecting these short T1 cholesterol and lipid components. It was soon recognized, however, that non-hemorrhagic plaques were not particularly bright on T1-weighted images. The reason for this is that water content in the atheromatous core is 10x higher than lipid, thus dominating the MR signal. Only in recent years have advanced techniques (including diffusion and water suppression methods) allowed some headway to be made into detecting and imaging these lipid components. Craniopharygiomas frequently contain high T1 signal cystic areas, and it is common to hear or read that cholesterol is at least partially responsible for this. Indeed, these cysts often do contain large amounts of cholesterol which surgeons can see as golden flecks floating on a sea of \"motor-oil\" colored fluid. In 1992 Ahmadi et al compared the MR appearance to cyst content in 10 cases and showed that the T1 signal was unrelated to cholesterol or lipid content. Instead, the short T1 seen in craniopharyngiomas is likely due to high protein content, blood products (methemoglobin), or both. A cystic craniopharygioma with high T1 signal. This is not likely due to cholesterol or lipids but to proteins and/or blood products. Cholesterol granuloma at the petrous apex. The bright T1 signal is due to blood products, not cholesterol. Cholesterol granulomas are uncommon lesions that typically occur at the apex of the petrous temporal bone. These lesions are characteristically bright on T1-weighted images and do contain very high concentrations of cholesterol. However, the cholesterol they contain is not a liquid ester, but is crystalline (with T2 values so short as to render their signals undetectable). Further proof that lipids are not responsible for the MR appearance is that these lesions do not have a surrounding chemical shift artifact nor suppress with fat saturation pulses. The high T1 signal is instead due to the paramagnetic effects of blood products characteristically associated with these lesions. Outside the central nervous system and vascular system it is likewise difficult to find well documented examples of cholesterol alone causing definitive T1 shortening. Clear cell renal carcinoma is a common somatic tumor known to contain moderately large levels of cholesterol but these tumors are seldom bright on T1-weighted images. It is possible that chemical shift imaging may detect lipids within them, but even if true, these tumors also contain triglycerides and free fatty acids so there is no proof that cholesterol is the principal moiety responsible for this behavior. Biliary cholesterol is often cited as the reason concentrated bile and gallbladder sludge appears bright on T1-weighted images. However, several H MR spectroscopy studies have shown that nearly all of the MR signal in bile comes from water, not lipid protons. Additionally, the molar percent cholesterol actually decreases by about 40% between dilute and fully concentrated bile, presumably due to reabsorption in the gallbladder wall. Mucin is often present in high concentration in biliary sludge, so water-macromolecular interactions with mucin is more likely responsible for the high T1 signal. Gallbladder sludge is bright on this T1-weighed image. Cholesterol polyps of the gallbladder, although hard to see because of their small size, are often hyperintense on T1-weighted images. Pathologically they consist of fat-laden macrophages and foam cells. Although they contain liquid crystal forms of cholesteryl esters and cholesterol precursors, they also contain abundant triglycerides which may explain the T1 shortening observed. Cholesterol gallstones serve as a final example, which are well known to have low signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images. This is because the cholesterol in gallstones is in a solid state, with very short T2 values. A bright gallstone on T1-weighted images is therefore most likely a pigment stone, whose T1 is shortened by water interaction with its mucin-glycoprotein matrix.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/t1-bright---cholesterol.html"}

The idea that blood flow velocities could be encoded by phase was first developed by my mentor, Paul R. (\"Dick\") Moran in the early 1980's. Dick had trained under the great Charlie Slichter, a famous researcher at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who had discovered J-coupling and was the author of the most widely read textbook in the field for several decades. Charlie, in turn, had been trained by Nobel Prize winner Ed Purcell. So that's my lineage back to NMR royalty! Moran analyzed the phase effects on stationary and moving spins subjected to a pair of bipolar gradients as illustrated in the diagram right. A stationary spin subjected to such a gradient pair will experience no net phase shift, but a moving spin will have a net phase shift proportional to its velocity. Two spins flowing at the same speed but in opposite directions will have equal but opposite phase shifts. By measuring changes in phase, therefore, velocity can be computed. Effect of bipolar phase-encoding gradients. Net phase gain is zero for stationary spins but positive for spins moving in the direction of the gradients. Usually bipolar gradients are applied along only one anatomic axis ( x -, y -, or z -) at a time to provide flow sensitivity in that specific direction. However, flow-encoding gradients may be applied along two or more axes simultaneously to measure flow sensitivity along any arbitrary direction. This method will not produce an angiographic image but is the basis for phase contrast flow measurements widely used in cardiovascular MRI and discussed in detail in subsequent Q&A's. The amplitude, duration, and spacing of the bipolar gradients determine the degree of sensitivity to slow or fast flows. This is controlled by an operator-selectable parameter known as velocity encoding (VENC) which must be prescribed prior to any PC MRI/MRA study. Proper setting of VENC is critical to the performance of the study and is the subject of a separate Q&A . By applying bipolar gradients sequentially along the cardinal directions ( x -, y -, and z -) and measuring phase shifts, velocity components of flow along each direction ( v x , v y , and v z ) can be computed. The flow data obtained from a PC study may obtained in 1D, 2D, 3D, or 4D mode. It can be used not only for blood flow measurements, but to depict the flow of any fluid such as CSF. It can be displayed in various ways: as a directionally-insensitive magnitude (\"speed\") image similar to a TOF MRA; in a Doppler-like directionally sensitive color- or gray-scale format; or even in cine mode. 2D PC MR venogram 3D PC MR angiogram PC flow mapping at aortic root The most commonly used applications today for phase-contrast imaging are: 1) in 2D mode to create a quick vascular scout image prior to performing a non-PC MRA technique; 2) in cine mode to quantify blood flows and velocities within the heart and great vessels; 3) in cine mode for qualitative or quantitative CSF flow measurements; 4) in 2D or 3D mode for intracranial MR venography; and 5) as a 3D MR angiogram for niche applications including MRA of the renal arteries and intracranial MRA in the presence of hemorrhage. The use of 3D-PC-MRA as a general angiographic method has greatly declined due to its long acquisition times and the availability of newer sequences (SSFP, FSE, and ASL) to perform the same function.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/phase-contrast-mra.html"}

Chemical shifts result from the differential electron shielding of H nuclei in molecules. Nuclei that are less shielded have larger chemical shifts (higher values of  ) . The degree of shielding can be estimated by looking at the electronegativity of nearby molecular groups, especially proximity to oxygen (O) atoms, double bonds, and aromatic rings. These concepts are illustrated in the diagram below and explained more completely in the sections that follow. Tetramethylsilane (TMS),  = 0 Tetramethylsilane (TMS) Tetramethylsilane (TMS) serves as the reference standard for H NMR spectroscopy, being arbitrarily assigned the value  = 0. TMS was chosen for this role because its H nuclei are highly shielded by electron clouds. The central Si and C atoms have low electronegativities and the molecule is symmetric. The H nuclei of nearly all other organic molecules will be less shielded than those of TMS, and hence have larger chemical shifts. Aliphatic protons,  = 1  2 Most aliphatic protons, such as those contained in fat (triglycerides), are covalently bonded to carbon atoms in relatively long (16-20 atom) chains. Carbon is only weakly electronegative, and the covalently bonded -(CH 2 )- groups possess electron clouds that effectively shield the protons from externally applied fields. Most aliphatic lipids, therefore, have chemical shifts not too far removed from the tetramethylsilane (TMS) reference, usually in the  = 1.0-1.5 range. Water protons ,  = 4.65 Deshielding of H nuclei due to the highly electronegative oxygen atom in water. Unlike the H nuclei of fats and simple alkanes, water protons are bonded to highly electronegative oxygen atoms. The electron clouds are pulled toward the oxygen atom, and the H protons are deshielded . Unlike fat protons nestled in long covalent carbon-containing chains, water protons are more \"exposed\" to the externally applied field. They thus experience a higher local field and resonate faster than aliphatic protons. The exact chemical shift of water will vary by temperature, pH, hydrogen bonding, and presence of dissolved solutes and gases. Aromatic protons,  = 6  8 Aromatic (phenolic) protons, such as those found in cholesterol and other compounds containing benzene rings, have even larger chemical shifts, in the range of 6-8 ppm. The reason for this large chemical shift relates to the circulation of the delocalized () electrons around the aromatic ring. The local field induced by circulation of these electrons serves to augment the applied field for benzylic protons along the plane of the ring, causing them to experience a higher local field than would otherwise be expected. Accentuated local fields experienced by benzylic hydrogens due to circulation of -electrons Carboxylic acids and aldehydes,  = 9  12 Carbonyl groups (C=O) are magnetically anisotropic and electronegative. They induce strong deshielding of nearby H nuclei lying within their plane. This explains the relatively large  values for carboxylic acids (R-COOH) and aldehydes (R-COH). Metallo-proteins (large   's) Very large chemical shifts (below 50 to over +100 ppm) may be observed for H nuclei in close proximity to paramagnetic ions such as Fe +3 in metallo-proteins such as deoxyhemoglobin. This results from the so-called hyperfine shift mechanism arising from scalar and dipolar interactions between the proton and unpaired electrons near the metallic centers. Depending on geometry the shifts may be either positive or negative. These large-shifted peaks are generally quite small, since the overwhelming majority of protons are not near the paramagnetic centers and continue to exhibit  -values in the \"normal\" range (0 - 12 ppm).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/predicting-delta.html"}

As described in a previous Q&A , the typical diffusion-weighted imaging protocol begins with production of a baseline b0 image obtained with all diffusion-sensitizing gradients turned off. Immediately thereafter, diffusion gradients are applied individually and in various combinations to produce a set of source images sensitized to diffusion along various directions. At least three sets of source images must be obtained. These may be along the laboratory x -, y -, and z -axes or in three arbitrary perpendicular orientations. More modern schemes typically obtain source images in 6, 20 or more directions, but three is the minimum. b0 image Diffusion source images obtained with gradients applied along the x-, y-, and z-directions. If S o is the signal intensity of a point in the b0 image, and the directionally-specific diffusion coefficients at the same point are D xx , D yy , and D zz , the signal intensities of the x-, y- , and z- direction source images are given by The individual source images are not usually viewed separately, but combined into a single final set for diagnosis. These combined images are known by various names: diffusion-weighted images , isotropic images , or trace images . The most common method of image combination is to take the geometric mean: Trace DW image In a prior Q&A we explained that biological tissues are anisotropic . They have multiple diffusion coefficients that vary by direction and are represented by the diffusion tensor , a 3x3 array of numbers. The term \"trace\" comes from matrix algebra where it means the sum of diagonal elements of such an array. The trace of the diffusion tensor ( D trace ) equals ( D xx + D yy + D zz ). Using the average value of the trace, ( D xx + D yy + D zz )/3, reduces the multi-directional diffusivity at each point into a single number that can be considered a consolidated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) . Thus the terms average trace and ADC are often used interchangeably. Trace DWI of stroke The signal intensity of each voxel in a Trace DW image is inversely related to its ADC value. Lesions that restrict diffusion (strokes, abscesses, etc.) lower the ADC and appear bright. Conversely, substances with unrestricted diffusion and high ADC's (like cerebrospinal fluid) appear dark. The Trace DW image is not a map of diffusion; it is only diffusion- weighted , a fact implicit in its name. Trace DW images possess considerable T2-weighting. As such, lesions with either very long or very short T2 values may \"contaminate\" the Trace DW images, making them appear \"artificially\" bright or dark. These important phenomena are known as \"T2-shine-through\" and \"T2-black-out\", the subject of later Q&A's. T2-effects can be mathematically removed from the DW image to create a pure parametric image of apparent diffusion coefficients (the \" ADC Map \"). The ADC Map is created by dividing the signal from the trace-DW image ( S DWI ) by the signal ( S o ) from each corresponding point in the b0 image and then taking logarithms: ADC map of stroke The ADC map is a pure display of consolidated ADC values. Because it is mathematically calculated it appears \"pixel-ly\" with \"spots\" scattered in the air around the subject.

An example is shown below: Contrast-enhanced pituitary MRI using keyhole technique. Note left sided microadenoma (arrow) seen on dynamic portion of study, invisible at 5 min. The technique is also called \"keyhole\" imaging , deriving from the k -space representation of the sequence, which resembles a slot or keyhole. The middle (pink) portion of k -space (the keyhole) contains low spatial frequency information  overall brightness or darkness and general shapes within the image. The peripheral portions of k -space (gray) contain high spatial frequency information (edges and details). When gadolinium contrast passes through the anatomy of interest, only the general brightness or darkness change significantly. This dynamic information can be obtained from sampling the center of k -space only. In the basic keyhole method, an initial pre-contrast reference image is obtained at full resolution using the complete set of k -space data. Following contrast injection, the center of k -space is repeatedly sampled every few seconds while the periphery is only sampled occasionally. Because only the central keyhole data changes during a dynamic acquisition, an appreciable savings in scan time can be achieved by not rescanning the periphery. Final images at full resolution are then reconstructed using the peripheral k -space data from the reference data set and central k -space data from the keyhole sets.

A single company ( LivaNova , formerly Cyberonics) produces virtually all VNS systems for neurologic use world-wide. Current models include the AspireSR  and Sentiva  . VNS systems resemble cardiac pacemakers. They consist of a battery and pulse generator (typically implanted subcutaneously in the upper chest) and a lead with terminal electrodes placed adjacent to a segment of the vagus nerve (usually in the mid-neck). The standard stimulation regimen is 30 seconds every 5 minutes, but can be adjusted by an external programming device on a patient-by-patient basis. Newer models also detect changes in heart rate (that can increase immediately before a seizure) and automatically apply extra stimulating pulses. An external hand-held magnet placed over the pulse generator can temporarily increase stimulation rate when needed during a seizure LivaNova VNS Therapy devices are classified as MR Conditional . Device interrogation and programming is required by a healthcare professional both before and after MR imaging. Prior to entering the MR system room settings from the device should be recorded and output current set to zero. Standard limitations (field strength, SAR, etc) must be strictly followed.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding A cochlear implant (CI) is a small, surgically implanted electronic device that directly stimulates the cochlear (auditory) nerve to provide a sense of sound to patients who are profoundly deaf or severely hearing impaired. As shown in the diagram, the typical CI consists of an external microphone and processor that converts sound into electrical impulses. These impulses then travel to an external transmitter that electromagnetically couples with coils on an adjacent subcutaneous receiver. Both the receiver and transmitter contain small permanent magnets allowing them to remain closely apposed during use. The stimulator portion of the subcutaneous implant amplifies and further modifies the sound impulses, sending them down a wire that enters the cochlea through the round window. Signals in the coiled cochlear wire stimulate the cochlear nerve, thus creating a sense of hearing for the patient. Cochlear Implant. For many newer models the microphone, sound processor and transmitter are a single unit positioned over the receiver. Lateral skull x-ray of a newly placed cochlear implant. (External components have been removed) CT Scan of a patient whose cochlear implant magnet rotated 90 during MR. (From Bawazeer under CC BY) Susceptibility artifact from cochlear implant at 1.5 T The receiver/stimulator circuitry is housed in a shell of silicone, titanium, or ceramic and the electrode wires are relatively short. Thus there is no substantial concern about implant or wire heating for most CI's at fields 3.0T using normal operating mode. The major concerns all relate to the presence of the magnet in the receiver component. These include magnet movement, demagnetization, and imaging artifacts. Pain from magnet movement occurs in a substantial fraction of patients. It may be minimized by wrapping the head with a tight-fitting elastic bandage prior to entering the scanner. In some cases the internal magnet must be removed and replaced as a condition of scanning. (This entails simple outpatient surgery under local anesthesia). Magnet dislocation can also occur as in the example shown above left. The patient's head should ideally remain straightly aligned with the bore of the scanner; demagnetization or reversal of magnetization of the implant may occur if the head is tilted more than 30. Significant susceptibility artifacts from the implant are unavoidable if the magnet is present. The effect is greater at 3.0T than at 1.5T and worse with GRE than SE sequences. Usually the entire temporal bone and a moderate portion of the regional brain is obscured by these artifacts. About a half-dozen companies manufacture various forms of cochlear prostheses worldwide, the three largest (accounting for 95% of the market) being Cochlear Ltd (Lane Cove, NSW, Australia), MED-EL GmbH (Innsbruck, Austria), and Advanced Bionics Corp (Sylmar, CA, USA). With just a few exceptions, nearly all of the current production models are MR Conditional . Of course, the first \"condition\" is to remove all external components (microphone, processor, and transmitter) before entering the MRI room! And the second step is to absolutely confirm the exact brand and model number from the patient's implant information card or reliable medical record source. With so many different implants and their ever-changing designs, it is important to check the manufacturer's web site in each case before scanning a patient. The \"Conditions\" vary significantly (even from country to country) and must be followed exactly. Just because an implant has conditional approval at 1.5T, for example, does not mean that safe scanning at 0.5 or 1.0T is assured. Other restrictions may include closed vs open bore scanning, maximum allowable SAR, maximum spatial gradient field, optimal patient positioning, use of localized transmit coils, requirements for head wrapping, use of parallel transmit body coils, minimum allowable bone thickness beneath the implant site, time since implantation (some require 6-month waiting period), and whether magnet removal is merely recommended or strictly required prior to imaging. Cochlear implants were first developed in the 1960s and 1970s with commercial models appearing in the 1980s. A small number of MR-compatible devices were just becoming available in the mid-1990's, but for all practical purposes most implants before 2005-2010 should be considered MR Unsafe . Specific named MR Unsafe devices from this period that may potentially be encountered in clinical practice include the House and Vienna implants (3M), DX-10 (Neurolec), pre-2004 Nucleus models without removable magnets (Cochlear), and Clarion models 1.0, 1.2, and CII Bionic Ear (Advanced Bionics). Electrode arrays for cochlear and brainstem implants respectively If the cochlea is severely damaged or the cochlear nerve involved by tumor, the basic CI device (with some modifications) can be used to stimulate the brainstem directly. The resultant apparatus is then known as a brainstem auditory implant (BAI). For this application the distal wire must terminate in a paddle-like electrode grid rather than the half-banded linear array use for standard cochlear stimulation. The paddle is surgically implanted against the lateral pons to stimulate the cochlear nucleus. The same safety issues apply equally to both BAI's and CI's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/cochlear-implants.html"}

Complexes of the element gadolinium (Gd) are the most widely used of all MR contrast agents. Because of its unique electronic structure (described below), Gd is strongly paramagnetic. Paramagnetism is an intrinsic property of certain materials to become temporarily magnetized when placed in an external magnetic field. In fact, Gd is one of only four elements that can be magnetized at room temperature (the other three being iron, nickel, and cobalt). The powerful paramagnetic properties of Gd make it extremely useful as an MR contrast agent. Gadolinium is not directly seen in an MR image, but manifests its presence indirectly by facilitating the relaxation of nearby hydrogen protons. Gd preferentially shortens T1 values in tissues where it accumulates rendering them bright on T1-weighted images. Paramagnetism may exist over a wide dimensional range  from subatomic particles to atoms to entire molecules. Nuclear paramagnetism , the form responsible for the NMR phenomenon, is extremely weak except in the immediate vicinity of the nucleus. It plays little or no role in determining the gross paramagnetic properties of entire atoms like gadolinium. The form of paramagnetism exhibited by gadolinium compounds derives from electrons, not protons, and is known as Curie paramagnetism . Because electrons have the same spin () but a much smaller size than protons, their gyromagnetic ratios are 657 times larger. If these electrons remain unpaired in shells or bonding orbitals, the unbalanced spins produce a strong magnetic moment capable of inducing magnetic relaxation in nearby nuclei. This is the origin of the bulk paramagnetism possessed by elements such as gadolinium. Gadolinium has atomic number 64 on the periodic table. It occupies the central position in the lanthanide series of elements. Lanthanides are rare-earth metals grouped chemically because they possess partially filled inner shells of electrons ( 4f and 5d subshells). The electronic structure of the neutral Gd atom is shown right. Note the 7 unpaired electrons in its 4f subshell that account for the element's strong paramagnetism. In its ionized state, Gd +3 donates its 6s and 5d electrons for bonding, leaving its 4f 7 electron shell intact. The powerful magnetic moment of Gd is therefore largely maintained even when chelated to a ligand such as DTPA in a contrast agent formulation. Electron structure of the Gd atom.

Partial Fourier imaging techniques are reconstruction methods in which data from as little as one-half of k -space is used to generate an entire MR image. How can this be possible? This amazing result derives from the fact that some of the information in k -space is redundant. Provided no phase errors occur during data collection, k -space possesses a peculiar mirrored property known as conjugate ( or Hermitian ) symmetry . Conjugate symmetry applies to pairs of points (like P and Q ) that are located diagonally from each other across the origin of k -space. If the data at P is the complex number [ a+b i ], the data at Q is immediately known to be P's complex conjugate , [ ab i ]. Conjugate symmetry of P and Q. If the data for one is known, the other can be calculated. By an advanced but straightforward argument, conjugate symmetry can be shown to exist whenever a Fourier transform is performed on any real-valued function. In more concrete terms related to 2D MR imaging, the conjugately symmetric points represent corresponding data acquired on the rising and trailing tails of two echoes obtained with opposite phase encoding steps. In other words, the signal intensity of a point on the rising portion of an echo obtained using a positive phase-encode step is the complex conjugate of that on the downward portion of another echo obtained using the corresponding negative phase-encode step. Conjugate (Hermitian) symmetry of k -space. Mirror image locations across the origin of k -space have real components of the same sign but imaginary components of the opposite sign. The practical result of conjugate symmetry is that, in theory , only half of k -space data needs to be collected and the other half can be estimated. This can be translated into a reduction in imaging time, reduction in minimum echo time, or both. All image data sets contain some phase errors, and therefore the conjugate symmetry approximations are not perfect. The sources of these phase errors include the usual \"suspects\": B o inhomogeneity, susceptibility effects, eddy currents, physiologic motion, and spatial variations in transmit RF uniformity or surface coil sensitivity. As commercially implemented, therefore, partial Fourier techniques require sampling of slightly more than half the lines of k -space (typically about 60% for routine imaging, more for echo-planar imaging). These extra lines are then used to generate phase correction maps of k -space, allowing a more accurate prediction of missing values. Two types of partial Fourier imaging are used in common practice and are available as options on all major brands of scanners. These are known generically as \" read conjugate symmetry \" and \" phase conjugate symmetry \" respectively. These techniques are described more completely in the next two Q&As.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/partial-fourier.html"}

The degree of contrast enhancement (for a given dose, agent, and pulse sequence) increases with increasing field strength, being most noticeable between low-field (0.5T) and high-field (1.5T) imaging. To understand why this occurs we must review several basic concepts of relaxation and relaxivity introduced in a prior Q&A . The observed T1 relaxation rate (1/T1 obs ) caused by contrast material accumulating in a tissue is given by 1/T1 obs = 1/T1 t + r 1  [C] where 1/T1 t is the base relaxation rate of the tissue without contrast, [C] is the concentration of contrast agent within the tissue, and r 1 is the relaxivity of the contrast agent. By algebraic rearrangement it is possible to derive an expression for the percent change in tissue relaxation due to the contrast agent: % (1/T1 obs ) = (1/T1 obs  1/T1 t )  (1/T1 t ) = T1 t  r 1  [C] For a T1-weighted pulse sequence, percent change in 1/T1 obs can be taken as a surrogate for relative lesion enhancement. This equation is consistent with several features about contrast enhancement well recognized by clinical radiologists: Contrast enhancement is more obvious in tissues with baseline long T1 t values (i.e., tissues that are dark on T1-weighted images). More contrast [C] in a lesion means more enhancement. Contrast agents with higher T1 relaxivities ( r 1 ) values produce stronger enhancement. To understand how the field-strength dependence of contrast enhancement, we must consider how T1 t and r 1 each change as a function of B o . The field-dependence of tissue relaxation times has been discussed in a prior Q&A . In general, tissue T1 values increase with increasing field strength. This phenomenon occurs because the Larmor frequency scales with field strength and T1 relaxation requires energy exchanges near the Larmor frequency to be effective. With increasing Larmor frequencies a progressive mismatch occurs with molecular motions in solid tissues, resulting in inefficient energy transfer and longer T1 values. The field dependence of gadolinium-based MR contrast agents depends on the range of field strengths considered as well as the particular agent. The table right shows T1 relaxivities for nine commercially available contrast agents. In general a slight decrease in r 1 is noted for all agents with increasing field strength. The greatest percent decrease is seen from between low-field (0.5T) and high-field (1.5T). T1-relaxivities ( r 1 ) in plamsa at 37C as function of field strength (from Rohrer et al) The largest field strength dependency is noted for contrast agents with higher degrees of protein binding (MultiHance, Eovist). This results from the accentuated Larmor frequency-molecular motion mismatch similar to that seen with solid tissues described above. Because tissue T1 values increase while contrast agent relaxivities are about the same or decrease only slightly with increasing field strength, the net effect is an increase in relative contrast enhancement as field strength increases.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gd--field-strength.html"}

Frankly, I am not enthusiastic about the widespread clinical applicability of quantitative DCE at its present level of development. Looking critically at the existing literature, the reader will find significant site-to-site variability of measured parameters. When disparate tumors (such as lymphomas vs glioblastomas) are compared, statistically significant differences in variables like K trans and v e have been noted, but the overlap between groups makes these distinctions worthless in practice. In most of the brain tumor cases we have studied to date, quantitative DCE simply reinforces diagnostic probabilities obtainable by visual inspection of time-intensity contrast uptake curves or parameters obtainable by conventional, DSC, or DW imaging. If you do wish to believe, and want to see why some think quantitative DCE imaging has a bright future, read on. . . The pathophysiological basis of DCE imaging lies in the (imperfect) concept that more malignant/aggressive neoplasms have greater degrees of neovascularity. To supply nutrients to their rapidly proliferating cells, blood flow and blood volumes typically increase. The fraction of tissue occupied by blood vessels and plasma v p may also increase. Tumor blood vessels have increased surface areas and are also inherently leaky. Thus their permeabiltity-surface area products are elevated, and we would expect their K trans values to be high as well. Additionally, malignant tumors often have regions of necrosis producing in an increased extracellular space fraction ( v e ) compared to more benign tumors. One of the principal concepts driving oncologists to push for quantitative DCE imaging is its potential to predict and monitor tumor response. A number of new chemotherapeutic agents such as bevacizumab and cediranib are directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These agents are not directly cytotoxic against cancer cells, and hence do not result in immediate shrinkage of tumors. However, by reducing vascular permeability they affect K trans and v p , thus presenting a potentially quantifiable method to assess effectiveness of therapy. For similar reasons, DCE parameters hold promise to distinguish progression from pseudoprogression and recurrent tumor vs radionecrosis. Two of our cases showing application of DCE imaging to brain neoplasms after therapy are presented below.  enhancement  K trans  v e  v p 10 mos later Above .

{"id": "0fe1de7b-d524-4174-bb1a-b5521fc80249", "contents": "Specific Absorption Rate What is SAR? SAR stands for \" specific absorption rate \" and is a measure of the amount of power deposited by a radiofrequency field in a certain mass of tissue. The units for SAR are therefore given in watts per kilogram (W/kg). 10-g averaged SAR map in a subject (From Brink et al under CC BY) The calculation of SAR in human subjects is very complex (and imprecise), requiring sophisticated mathematical modeling and computer simulations. All commercially available MR scanners have programs that estimate SAR values automatically when a specific imaging protocol is selected and warn the operator if regulatory limits are likely to be exceeded. However, each manufacturer uses a different proprietary algorithm, so calculated SAR values may differ substantially among vendors. SAR estimation also requires an accurate patient weight to be input by the technologist (although most modern scanners also monitor transmitted power to prevent excessive RF exposure if an incorrect weight has been entered). Though not accurate enough for human studies, considerable insight into the factors contributing to SAR can be obtained by considering a simple model like that illustrated below. In this example we calculate the induced currents and power deposition in a circular region of a homogeneously conducting material subjected to intermittent \"hard\" rectangular single-frequency RF-pulses. [Click image to enlarge]. Simplified, 2-dimensional model to demonstrate the factors contributing to SAR. A sketch of the mathematic derivation is on the right from above downward. with reasoning as indicated. Note that we have considered B1 to be linearly polarized and applied as intermittent \"hard\" rectangular pulses at a single frequency (). We have ignored capacitive or inductive effects, considering losses to be purely resistive. We have not accounted for factors like pulse shape or new field generated by displacement currents. More detailed analyses can be found in the references. The final equation derived from this simplified model reveals some important features that contribute to SAR: SAR is proportional to the electrical conductivity of tissue () . Tissue conductivity varies by a factor of 10 across the body, being largest in high water content materials like blood and urine and lowest in tissues like bone, fat, and lung. Foreign metal objects in the body are frequently highly conductive and significant (even dangerous) heating levels around these may occur. SAR increases significantly with body size . In our 2-dimensional model we found SAR proportional to A , the square of the body cross-sectional area. Because A = r (where r is the radius), our model predicts SAR proportional to r 4 . When the third dimension is considered, SAR actually proves to be more closely proportional to r 5 . SAR tends to be concentrated more around the periphery (where the radius is larger). So larger and obese patients are more at risk. In a homogeneous sphere, 87% of the RF power dissipation occurs in its the outer third. Even in inhomogeneous humans, the peripheral deposition of heat can be appreciated in the SAR map above. Fortunately heat deposited on the perimeter of the body can be more easily dissipated. SAR is proportional to the square of the RF frequency (). Typically, the RF frequency is chosen to closely match the Larmor frequency, which, in turn, is directly proportional to static field strength B o . So, all other things being equal, SAR depends on the square of B o . The same pulse sequence in the same patient imaged at 1.5T would therefore generate 4x the SAR if performed at 3.0T. SAR is proportional to the square of the RF-flip angle (  ) . This follows from the fact that (  ) is proportional to the mean amplitude of the RF-pulse ( B 1 ). Since SAR is proportional to B 1  , it is also proportional to  . Thus a 180-pulse would create 4x the SAR as a 90-pulse. SAR is proportional to the duty cycle ( D ) . Duty cycle represents the percent time in a pulse sequence RF is being transmitted. Thus more intense sequences (with lots of RF pulses applied in a short period of time) generate high levels of SAR. Tissue Temperature (not SAR) is What Really Matters Radiofrequency injury to patients is the result of elevated tissue temperatures, not SAR itself. As a crude approximation, an SAR of 1 W/kg would increase the temperature of an insulated slab of tissue by about 1 C per hour. Additionally, some organs (like the eye and testis) are especially sensitive to heat-induced injury, while others are not. Although SAR is the dominant source of tissue heating, it is only one determinant of tissue temperature. Other critical factors include: regional perfusion, baseline patient body temperature, the patient's thermoregulatory capacity, ambient temperature, airflow through the scanner bore, relative humidity, clothing, and ability to perspire. Patients at risk for overheating include those with reduced thermoregulatory capacities  infants, pregnant women, the elderly, obese, diabetics, febrile patients, and those with cardiac decompensation. Certain medications  including beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, amphetamines, and sedatives  can also impair thermoregulatory responses. These factors should always be considered when scanning a susceptible patient, even if predicted SAR values seem to be within tolerable limits.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-sar.html"}

In a real-life MR scanner or other superconducting device, however, this idealized situation is not quite realized and the current will eventually die out, albeit very slowly. First, the loops of wire are not perfect, containing small defects, inclusions of foreign elements, and grain boundaries. The wires are also connected together at their ends by a soldered joint. These imperfections add a finite amount of resistance to the circuit. Secondly, NbTi (as well as other conductors that are not simple elements) is a T ype II superconductor . In Type II superconductors the Meissner effect does not completely eject all of the magnetic field from the wire.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a critical part of neurosurgical practice, especially for treatment of patients with traumatic head injury. As described in a prior Q&A , extraventricular drainage (EVD) systems are commonly used for this purpose and constitute the \"gold standard\" for ICP measurement (if not kinked or partially occluded). The current Q&A deals with electronic ICP measurement devices that utilize small catheters (probes) placed through the skull connected to bedside monitors. Many variations and configurations are possible: The catheter/probe can be placed to measure pressure in the brain parenchyma, ventricle, or extra-axial space(s). The catheter/probe may be fixed in place by a bolt screwed into the skull, or it may be tunneled under the scalp and passed intracranially through a simple burr hole. Some ICP monitoring systems have additional capabilities, including: measurement of temperature and/or partial pressure of oxygen in the brain; depth EEG recording; aspiration/drainage of CSF; and wireless transmission. Multifunction ICP catheter with bolt (from Raumedic) About a half-dozen companies manufacture implantable ICP devices worldwide. Three basic transducer (sensing element) designs are used: Piezoelectric strain gauges are the most common ICP type, exemplified by the Codman CereLink ( Integra LifeSciences ), the Neurovent ( Raumedic ), and the Pressio ( Sophysa ). The piezoelectic transducer lies at the tip of the nylon catheter in direct contact with the brain or CSF, which when deflected by pressure change generates a current. An electrical adaptor is at the end which connects to an external monitor. Nearly all of these devices are MR Conditional . Pneumatic sensors have a tiny balloon near the tip of the catheter, that when filled with air, transmits pressure waves to a diaphragm where both ICP and brain compliance can be measured. Examples include the Spiegelberg ICP Catheter ( Spiegelberg ), the ICB/T Pressure Transducer (  Gaeltec  ), and the Hummingbird  ( IRRAS ). Nearly all of these devices are MR Conditional . Fiberoptic transducers employ a fiber optic cable to transmit light toward a displaceable mirror that moves in response to changes in ICP. A microprocessor translates differences in light phase and intensity into pressure measurement. Several companies have stopped producing these devices in recent years due to their performance and MR incompatibility, but one is still available  the MR Unsafe Camino  ICP Monitoring System ( Natus ).

As described in multiple prior Q&As , gradients are sets of electromagnets located behind the walls of MR scanners used for spatial encoding and signal generation. Gradients distort the main magnetic field in a predictable fashion, causing the resonance frequency of protons to vary as a function of position. The strength of the magnetic fields generated by gradients are less than 3% of the main magnetic field ( B o ), so their static effects are of no concern. Rather, it is the time rate of change of these gradient fields ( dB/dt ) that poses potential safety issues for MR imaging. Location of gradient coils and resultant dB/dt fields in a cylindrical scanner. Note there are two \"hot spots\" near the scanner walls about 30 cm on either side of isocenter. (Lower half of image courtesy of Dr. E. Kanal, created using the MagnetVision app he created) A typical cylindrical MR scanner uses 3 sets of gradient coils, one set for each of the x- , y -, and z -directions. The gradients are typically thin wires or foil sheets in a \"fingerprint\"-type pattern held together by epoxy resin and encapsulated into an assembly that also incorporates cooling channels. As shown in the illustration, the x - and y -gradient coils are arranged in pairs located on either side of isocenter. This arrangement means that the highest values of dB/dt are not located in the middle of the scanner, but eccentrically near the ceiling and walls, typically about  30 cm from isocenter ( z = 0). The peak values of dB/dt next to the wall are about three times larger than those measured in the middle of the scanner at the same z -axis location. Peak dB/dt values occur during gradient ramp up and ramp down periods. Gradient coils are powered by high voltage/high current amplifiers located in an adjacent equipment room. Voltages of up to 1500V and currents of several hundred amperes are typical. In standard use the gradients are switched on and off quickly, with slew rates as high as 200 T/m/s. These rapidly changing currents flowing through the coils produce two major physical effects: a) mechanical vibration of the gradient system (and secondarily the scanner itself), and b) induced currents in nearby conductive materials proportional to dB/dt , the rate of change of the gradient field (a manifestation of Faraday's Law ). These physical effects of rapid current flows through the gradients give rise to three potential MR safety concerns discussed in subsequent Q&A's: Acoustic noise Nerve/cardiac stimulation Heating around implants", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gradient-safety-overview.html"}

A fundamental property of resonance phenomena in any media (mechanical, electrical, acoustic, magnetic) is that the response is maximal at a specific frequency and requires energy input including that frequency. Grandmother Mimi pushing my triplet daughters (Martha, Ellie, & Patti) on our backyard swing at precisely the resonant frequency. How did she know? A familiar example is pushing a child on a swing. The child-swing system, like a pendulum, has a natural resonance frequency that depends on the weight of the child and the length of the chains. Optimal swinging height is achieved when the frequency of pushing closely matches the natural frequency of the swing. Pushing faster or slower provides a less efficient transfer of energy. The same situation holds for NMR. Here the energy is supplied in the form of a rotating magnetic field, denoted B 1 , which is applied for a short time in the plane perpendicular to B o . To supply energy to the spin system and tip the net nuclear magnetization ( M ), the B 1 field must rotate very near the resonance (precession) frequency of the protons. If B 1 rotates at any other frequency then it would be alternately in and out of phase with the spins which produce M . Only when the rotation rate of B 1 closely matches the precession frequency can M and B 1 remained locked together in the appropriate relation for tipping and energy exchange. The absorption and exchange of energy constitute a resonance phenomenon, sharply tuned to the natural nuclear precession frequency. The natural precession frequency of a spin system is also known as the Larmor frequency .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-at-larmor-frequency.html"}

Because of their durability, cost, and ease of placement, MR-safe silicone stents are most widely used for benign disease. Metal stents are most frequently used to treat airway strictures and compression due to malignant disease. The earliest all-metal airway stents ( Gianturco, Wallstent, Palmaz) were made of stainless steel and were repurposed models originally designed for use in the vascular or gastrointestinal systems. Although still available, most modern metal stents are made of non-ferromagnetic alloys, especially Nitinol (Ni-Ti) or Elgiloy (Co-Cr-Ni-Mo) . They may be uncovered (bare metal) or covered (with a layer of silicone or plastic). Although not all metallic stents have undergone rigorous testing, they should be viewed as MR Conditional at least up to 3.0T without significant worries concerning heating or displacement. Expect the stainless steel stents to produce considerable MR artifact, however. \"MR Unsafe\" Dynamic Y-Stent (Boston Scientific) I am aware of only one currently manufactured airway stent declared MR Unsafe by its manufacturer, the stainless steel Boston Scientific Dynamic (Y) Tracheobronchial Stent .

Coronary MRA is the most difficult of all vascular studies to perform well. The coronary arteries are small (2-4 mm), tortuous, and move in a complex fashion with each heart beat and with respiration. Recent advances and clinical success with coronary CTA have somewhat dampened enthusiasm and clinical applications for coronary MRA, though research continues on both. Coronary MRA may be useful in the following situations: 1) identification of anomalous coronary arteries; 2) detection of coronary artery ectasia or aneurysms in Kawasaki disease; 3) assessing the patency of coronary artery bypass grafts; and 4) demonstration of stenosis of native coronary arteries, especially in their proximal portions. Surface-display 3D MRA of the heart illustrating the tortuous course and small size of the coronary arteries. The complex motion of the heart during its contraction/relaxation cycle requires EKG-triggering and segmented image acquisition. A quick scout axial cine MRI study should be obtained to determine the pattern of gross cardiac motion and hence the optimal window for imaging. For most patients mid-to-late diastole is a particularly favorable time where gross motion is minimized and coronary flow is high. In pediatric patients with fast heart rates, however, the best time may be late systole. In patients of any age with rapid or irregular heart beats, the -blocker drugs may prove useful. Coronary MRA is likely to be unsuccessful in patients with frequent intruding arrhythmias. Compensation for respiratory motion is best performed using a navigator beam oriented perpendicular to the right hemidiaphragm. The navigator pulse is interleaved with the cardiac MRA sequence and permits image acquisition only when the diaphragm is within a predefined tolerance band near its end-expiratory position. The use of navigators improves patient comfort and tolerance since it allows free-breathing during what is often a somewhat lengthy (10+ minute) coronary MRA study. Pulse sequences for coronary MRA include black blood and bright blood techniques. Black-blood 2D techniques are relatively easy to perform and may be perfectly adequate if only limited information is needed, such as the origins of coronary arteries. For general coronary MRA, however, non-contrast bright blood techniques are currently the most popular. Two strategies are available: 1) a single 3D-volumetric sequence covering the entire heart, or 2) two shorter duration slab acquisitions targeting the right and left coronary systems respectively. 2D Black-blood MRA showing origin and course of the right coronary artery. For optimal spatial resolution of the entire coronary tree, a (nearly) isotropic 3D data set is required. The best results to date have been obtained using segmented b-SSFP sequences with T2-magnetization preparation and frequency-selective fat suppression. Parallel imaging is mandatory to keep acquisition times in a tolerable range. Pre-scan shimming is also recommended. A commercially available coronary artery MRA sequence offered on Philips systems is illustrated below. Coronary MRA pulse sequence offered by Philips. The T2 Prep module is a short train (1-4) of nonselective RF-pulses to suppress tissues with short T2 values and accentuate blood. Two SPIR fat suppression pulses (yellow) are used. The first suppresses fat along the navigator (NAV) beam to improve its stability, while the second suppresses epicardial fat surrounding the coronary arteries. A spatial saturation (SAT) pulse is placed on the chest wall for fold-over suppression. Image acquisition (pink) occurs during late diastole. A balanced-SSFP readout is typically employed, but other methods (turbo-SE, EPI, hybrid GRE-EPI) are also possible. In this example a radial profile order beginning at the center of k -space with clipping of k -space corners is used (\" k -space shuttle\"), so the trigger delay is defined from the R-wave to the start of data acquisition. Multiplanar reformation of 3D data set shows proximal course(s) of the right and left coronary arteries. Following image acquisition multiplanar and curved reformations of the 3D (volumetric) data set are required to display the course(s) of the coronary arteries. An example is shown left. Promising future developments include: 1) coronary artery MRA at 3T where improved spatial resolution is possible due intrinsically higher signal-to-noise; 2) the use of intravascular contrast agents; 3) compressed sensing; 4) deep learning reconstruction methods; and 5) phase-contrast imaging to quantify blood flow in the proximal coronary arteries. Head-to-head comparison studies will be needed to determine the role(s) coronary artery MRA will ultimately play in evaluating patients with known or suspected heart disease, especially in light of the great successes now being touted for coronary CTA.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/coronary-artery-mra.html"}

Methemoglobin (met-Hb) , a brownish hemoglobin derivative, results from the oxidative denaturation of its precursor, deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) . If you have ever seen older meat change color from pink to reddish-brown you have witnessed the formation of met-hemoglobin in your very own refrigerator! The older steak (right) has a brownish hue due to the presence of met-Hb (and even more so from accumulation of its analogue, met-myoglobin.) To allow reversible binding of oxygen (O 2 ), the iron centers of deoxyhemoglobin must remain in the reduced, ferrous (Fe +2 ) state. Once hemoglobin has been removed from the high-oxygen environment of the circulation, however, various metabolic pathways (e.g., methemoglobin reductase) fail, allowing heme iron to become oxidized to the ferric (Fe +3 ) form, methemoglobin. As a result of this change in valence state, met-Hb is unable to bind oxygen. The transition from deoxy-Hb to met-Hb requires the loss of an electron from each iron center and rearrangement of electron spins in the 3d subshell. The end result is that met-Hb has 5 unpaired electrons, rendering it slightly more paramagnetic than deoxy-Hb (which has only 4 unpaired electrons). By comparison, gadolinium used for MR contrast agents has 7 unpaired electrons, the most of any element. Test tube with blood sample containing 70% methemoglobin. (Aquo)-methemoglobin, where H 2 O interacts with the Fe center, resulting in powerful inner-sphere T1-relaxation. Also with the ferrous-ferric transition, the crevices in the globin subunits that previously allowed binding of oxygen are reshaped permitting access of water very close to the iron centers for the first time. The resulting complex is known as aquo-methemoglobin . This allows so-called inner sphere relaxation to occur, resulting in very short T1 values (and corresponding brightness on T1-weighted images). As long as met-Hb continues to be compartmentalized intracellularly, however, local magnetic susceptibility effects persist and the hematoma remains dark on T2/T2*-weighted images. The subacute stage of hematoma formation is therefore distinguished chemically and radiologically by the presence and location of methemoglobin. The early subacute phase (illustrated below 2 days - 1 week) is characterized by intracellular met-Hb . The late subacute phase (1 week - 2 months, described in a later Q&A ) is characterized by extracellular met-Hb . Above: Imaging characteristics of early subacute hematomas (typical time frame, 2 days - 1 week). During this stage intracellular methemoglobin predominates. Below: MR images obtained about 3 days after hemorrhage illustrating prominent intracellular methemoglobin formation. Hematoma is hyperintense to brain on T1-weighted image (top left). Center of hematoma is markedly hypointense on T2-weighted image (top center). A halo of high signal edema in the surrounding brain is noted.

In MRS spatial frequency-encoding cannot be used since frequency differences must be reserved for identifying chemical shifts between molecular species. Several localization strategies are available: 1) Single voxel methods; 2) Multi-voxel methods; and 3) Surface coil methods. Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS) Single-voxel techniques use sequentially applied RF-pulses coupled with gradients in three orthogonal planes. The intersection of these planes defines a cube-shaped voxel as the source of the MR signal. Intersection of 3 orthogonal planes defines a cubic voxel for SVS. Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS) Three principal SVS methods are in common use, distinguished by the nature and timing of RF-pulses and the types of signal generated: Point RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) is the most popular method for H spectroscopy. It uses 3 RF-pulses (90 18 018 0 ) and generates a spin-echo signal. Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) uses three 90 -pulses and generates a stimulated echo . Because of its inferior signal-to-noise compared to PRESS, STEAM has progressively fallen out of favor for H spectroscopy during the last decade for fields  3.0 T. Image-Selected In vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS ) . Unrelated to the terrorist organization, ISIS is used primarily for P spectroscopy. Free induction decay signals are generated from 8 separate RF-pulse cycles, then added and subtracted in a certain order to define the volume of interest. (Multi-Voxel) Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) is the traditional name for a group of MRS techniques also referred to by the more modern term MR Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) . Spectra can be simultaneously obtained in 1D (a column of voxels), 2D (a plane of voxels), or 3D (block of voxels). 2-D Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) CSI phase-encoding can be combined with any type of excitation and signal generation method. In the simplest possible case, the entire volume could be excited with a non-selective RF-pulse, with sampling of an FID signal after each phase-encoding step. More commonly, excitation is performed using spatially selective RF-pulses and gradients similar to PRESS, STEAM, or ISIS . The use of multiple gradient steps means that CSI-methods (especially those in 3D) are time-intensive compared to SVS techniques. To speed data acquisition, various methods (including parallel imaging, reduced k -space sampling, and multi-band excitation) may be used. A relatively straightforward method to reduce imaging time is to acquire two or more echoes during each TR interval. This technique is known as Turbo Spectroscopic Imaging (TSI) , with its obvious analogy to turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging. Surface Coil Localization Surface coil localization combining sensitive volume with 1D CSI For multinuclear (i.e, non- H) spectroscopy, small surface coils tuned to the nucleus of interest are typically p laced directly over the desired anatomy (heart, liver, muscle). Such coils have a conical receptive fields extending into tissue a distance approximately equal to their diameters. If nonselective RF-pulses are applied without spatial gradients, the resultant signal derives from the entire sensitive volume of the coil (i.e., a single giant hemispheric shaped voxel). If slice-selective RF-excitation or phase-encoding gradients are used, then more specific localization to disks, single, or multiple voxels can be obtained. A summary of the major MRS localization methods, together with their advantages and disadvantages is provided in the Table below. More details about PRESS, STEAM, ISIS, and CSI can be found in dedicated Q&A's related to each technique.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/localization-methods.html"}

Metals have high intrinsic magnetic susceptibilities (  ) that produce significant local field disturbances with both in-plane and through-plane changes in resonance frequency. By altering resonance frequencies metals shift image pixels away from their true positions leading to significant geometric distortions including signal voids (black areas) and signal pile-ups (bright areas). Several methods for minimizing metal-related artifacts exist. As the important first step in reducing metal-related artifacts, use the lowest field strength magnet possible. Susceptibility artifacts scale with field strength, so you are nearly always better off scanning that total hip replacement patient in that older 1.5T scanner rather than in your brand new 3.0T unit! Even without purchasing specialized software, judicious use of standard techniques can be used to reduce the size of these artifacts. First and foremost, a fast (turbo) spin-echo pulse sequence with short echo spacing should be employed, as the multiple 180-refocusing pulses applied at close intervals will partially correct for dephasing due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Receiver bandwidth should also be increased to as large a value as possible consistent with an acceptable level of signal-to-noise. Reducing slice thickness and using parallel imaging acceleration will also help. Avoid spectral fat suppression and use STIR instead. Metallic susceptibility artifacts in spine from pedicle screws Artifacts decreased by metal reduction technique Before resigning to failure, it is also worth trying to image the area in at least three different planes. I have been pleasantly surprised on numerous occasions that while a metal artifact may make images uninterpretable in two planes, the third plane may be substantially free of artifact and allow a diagnosis to be made. This is purely a trial-and-error method, but may help you when you are in a pinch. Major MR vendors also offer specially designed software techniques to minimize metal artifacts, sometimes called generically called MARS (Metal Artifact Reduction Sequences) . Several methods are used to accomplish this goal. Reducing In-Plane Distortions: View Angle Tilting (VAT) Since its development in the 1980's, VAT has become a commonly used and well-established technique for reducing in-plane image distortions due to susceptibility effects. Philips original O-MAR (Orthopedic Metal Artifact Reduction) and Siemens original WARP techniques were 2D Turbo SE sequences based on VAT. The principle of VAT is that magnetic susceptibility artifacts cause displacements in both the readout and slice-select directions. By applying an additional (VAT) gradient during signal readout along the slice-select direction equal magnitude to the one applied during RF-excitation , the off-resonance displacements are made to cancel each other exactly. The VAT readout gradient results in a \"shearing\" of the imaged pixels, equivalent to viewing the slice at a slight angle so that the displaced in-plane pixels do not overlap. The VAT method in theory thus fully compensates for in-plane pixel shifts in the readout direction. Although adequately correcting for in-plane distortions, VAT produces image blurring due to geometric slice shear as well as the low-pass filtering effect of the additional VAT gradient. These effects can be minimized by using thinner sections, higher matrix resolution, and higher bandwidths. Reducing Through-Plane Distortions: SEMAC and MAVRIC Through-plane (i.e., slice-to-slice) magnetic field distortions due to metal are more challenging to correct. Two closely related techniques have been developed to accomplish this: SEMAC (Slice Encoding Magnetic Artifact Compensation) and MAVRIC (Multi-Acquisition Variable Resonance Image Combination). The SEMAC technique utilizes both a VAT-compensation gradient (to reduce in-plane displacements) plus additional phase-encoding steps in the slice-select direction (to reduce through-plane displacements). This additional phase-encoding from overlapping volumes obtained at discrete frequency offsets provides information on how metallic susceptibility effects have distorted the original slice profile. Reconstruction software can then correct for signals shifted perpendicular to the imaging plane. Software choices include the number of overlap volumes to be acquired (more volumes = less artifact but longer imaging times). The current products Siemens Advanced WARP and Philips O-MAR XD are based on SEMAC with VAT. Imaging times can be significantly reduced by combination of SEMAC with Compressed Sensing (CS) . MAVRIC is based on a 3D fast spin-echo sequence and employs narrow band frequency-selective excitation coupled with a multispectral VAT-type readout. \"Spectral bins\" are created that collect narrow excitation spectrum data both on-resonance and for a set of approximately 30 partially overlapping offset frequencies to measure in-plane displacements. M AVRIC also employs several additional features including image interleaving (to allow more freedom in TE & TR selection), adaptive phase-encoding (reducing number of phase encode steps and hence imaging time for off-resonance excitations, and a deblurring post-processing algorithm to remove artifacts from the reconstruction of imaging planes. Hitachi currently offers a MAVRIC-based technique called HiMAR (Hitachi Metal Artifact Reduction). The original MAVRIC technique did not utilize slab-selection gradients (relying on surface coils to restrict active signal in the z -direction). In certain locations like the hip and shoulder, significant through-plane aliasing artifacts often occurred, because coil sensitivies were not sufficient to provide volume selectivity. This limitation could be overcome by adding a z -gradient during both multispectral excitation and readout. The resultant sequence, called MAVRIC-SL , a GE product, is thus a hybrid between MAVRIC and SEMAC.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/metal-suppression.html"}

The walls along the inner bore of an MR scanner frequently become noticeably warm during the course of an imaging study. This heating is primarily caused by eddy currents and resistive heating as current is passed through the imaging gradients. Gradient coils are driven by powerful pulse-width modulated (PWM) amplifiers located in an equipment room that is usually directly adjacent to the magnet (scanning) room. For intense imaging applications is it not unusual for peak coil driving voltages to reach 2500 V and currents to exceed 1000 A. Intense gradient heat is created, with maximum internal coil temperatures reaching 55-60 C. The power required to operate a gradient coil scales with the fifth power of its radius. Thus gradient coil design and cooling is even more challenging for today's wide-bore (70 cm) scanners. All modern scanners use some sort of fluidic cooling to minimize heating. This is generally accomplished by circulating de-ionized water or an ethylene glycol solution from a heat exchange pump (\" chiller \") located in the adjacent magnet equipment room. The water flows through tubes, jackets, or channels in close relation to the gradient coils as shown in the illustration above. Some scanners also include forced air cooling around the gradients. Paired ('in'-'out') gray hoses (arrows) circulate water/ethylene glycol around the gradient coils for cooling Chiller (inside components) Chiller (outside components) More efficient cooling and reduction in \"hot spots\" have also resulted from improved design of the cylindrical formers (shells) on which the gradient coils are wound. These formers are being increasingly constructed from alumina-ceramic materials with markedly superior thermal conductivity properties than older plastic-fiberglass composites. In addition to heating of the gradients themselves, warmth also comes from eddy current heating of the radiofrequency (RF)-shield . The RF-shield lies between the gradient and RF-coils and serves to decouple the two during RF transmission. The RF-shield is closely apposed to the thin RF-coil and is thus located very near the inner plastic wall of the scanner bore. Care must be taken to keep large patients from touching the inner walls of the scanner as rarely burns have occurred when the patient's body becomes part of an eddy current loop.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gradient-heating.html"}

This step in prescan, also known as pulse amplitude calibration , determines the RF output necessary to achieve a 90 (or other flip angle) pulse. Recall from a prior Q&A that the flip angle () for a hard (rectangular) RF-pulse is given by  =   B 1  t p where  is the gyromagnetic ratio and t p represents the length of time the B 1 field is applied. The pulse length ( t p ) is typically fixed, and so the flip angle is controlled by varying the magnitude of the B 1 field. The magnitude of B 1 , in turn, is dictated by the output voltage and current of the RF-amplifier. This amplifier output is scaled downward from its maximum value by means of an interposed circuit (the transmit attenuator ). The attenuator controls the gain of the amplifier so that the proper current and voltage are sent to the coil to generate a B 1 field of appropriate magnitude. The gain/attenuator setting must be adjusted for each patient empirically because variable loading of the transmitter coil alters the required amplifier output case by case. Transmit attenuation is set automatically on all scanners although manual overrides are possible. The scanner accomplishes this task by sending out test RF pulses at variable attenuator settings and noting the amplitude of each FID signal created. When a maximum value is obtained, the attenuator is calibrated for a 90-pulse. From this, the attenuation values required for a 180 or other flip-angle pulse can be calculated by simple scaling.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/transmitter-gain.html"}

Thermal/electrical burns account for nearly two-thirds of clinically significant patient injuries in MRI. Most occur in the upper extremities or torso. Common causes are include: contact with a conductive object (e.g. RF coil, EKG pads/leads, clothing); contact with the wall of the scanner bore; and direct skin-to-skin contact. SAR \"hot-spot\" due to antenna effect at the tip of a deep brain stimulator. (From Iacono et al under CC BY) Three physical mechanisms underlying RF-induced thermal injury are recognized: Inductive heating . According to Faraday's Law, a changing magnetic field generates electrical currents, called eddy currents , in conductive materials. The human body is a reasonable conductor (owing to the presence ions in extracellular in intracellular fluids), and, of course, m etallic foreign materials are excellent conductors. When electric currents are channeled into a small area of high resistance (such as a metal-skin interface), heat is generated that may result in burns. Heating of a resonant loop . Certain electrical circuits are known to resonantly absorb and release energy at a specific frequency if they form a loop that contains both capacitance and inductance elements. For example, a coiled wire lying on a patient's stomach might contribute inductance, while the skin-metal interface at radiofrequencies becomes capacitive. Although a relatively uncommon situation, resonant loops may generate the highest level of inductive heating with burns possible. Antenna effect . Wires and elongated conductive objects can act like antennas, capturing electromagnetic waves to extract power from them. Antennas produce standing-wave patterns of voltage and current that are concentrated near their tips, maximal when their length is one-half of the RF wavelength. For MRI, therefore, wires measuring about 26 cm at 1.5T or 13 cm at 3.0T are the most likely to create heating problems. Surprisingly, many patients do not even know they are being burned and may only notice nothing or only minor pain or redness immediately after the scan. (The best theory for this is that the bulk of the initial injury has begun in the subcutaneous fat which lacks pain sensors.) It is not rare for patients to report blistering or increased redness and pain more than 24 hours after imaging.

Relaxation times as well as biomechanics of articular cartilage reflect its intrinsic microstructure. About  of cartilage is composed of water while the other  consists of Type II collagen with negatively charged proteoglycans interspersed between its fibrils. The superficial and transitional zones have higher water content and more loosely organized collagen, resulting in longer T2 values. Deeper layers have lower water content and shorter T2s, with collagen organized into dense radial bands. Trauma, degeneration, and inflammatory changes in articular cartilage are generally manifest by increased free water content and loss of proteoglycans, causing increased T2 relaxation times. A typical cartilage mapping sequence might consist of a set of 3-mm-thick slices obtained perpendicular to the cartilage surface. Four to six echoes at TE i 's from about 5 to 100 ms are obtained with TR and all other parameters held constant. These can be either spin echoes (to estimate T2) or gradient echoes to estimate T2*. T2 ( * ) calculations on a pixel by pixel basis can then made by fitting the recorded signal ( S ) to a first order model described by S = Ke TE i /T2 ( * ) . This is similar to methods used for quantifying iron deposition in the liver or heart described in a prior Q&A . After computation of relaxation times, color-coded maps are created to allow visual identification of T2 ( * ) changes within the cartilage. T2 mapping of the knee articular cartilage.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding \"MR conditional\" InterStim sacral nerve simulator Sacral nerve stimulators are an option for patients with refractory lower urinary tract dysfunction and/or fecal incontinence. Neuromodulation devices are made by several manufacturers, the most widely used being Medtronic's InterStim  (pictured right). Like cardiac pacemakers they have a titanium-encased pulse generator with battery subcutaneously planted in the upper buttocks, connected by a thin wire inserted through a sacral foramen (usually S3). The wire terminates as an electrode in the pelvis in the region of the S2-S4 sacral nerves. Sometimes the electrode is placed on the (more distal) dorsal genital or pudendal nerves, which contain more of the S2-S4 direct sensory fibers from the bladder so that motor stimulation in the buttocks is minimized. Some newer devices (e.g., the Axonics  SNM System ) have batteries rechargeable by transcutaneous induction. The Finetech-Brindley Bladder Control System (branded as VOCARE  in the US) has a different design. Implanted in over 3000 patients worldwide since the 1980s, this device treats urinary incontinence in persons with complete spinal cord injuries. The VOCARE system has both internal and external components. Laminectomies are performed with epidural placement of electrodes along the anterior S2, S3, and S4 roots. The posterior roots are surgically lysed to reduce unwanted sensory feedback contraction of the bladder.

The dose of gadolinium contrast for infants and children should be the same as that given to adults on a per kilogram basis. This recommendation takes into account two competing factors determining the effectiveness of contrast administration: biological half-life and volume of distribution. Since newborns and young infants have significantly lower glomerular filtration and renal clearance rates than do older children and adults, the biologic half-life of gadolinium-based MR contrast agents is prolonged. In a full-term newborn the half-life is 6.5 hours; it may be longer than 9 hours in premature infants. By two months of age, the infant half-life reaches the adult value of 1.5 hours. This prolonged half-life in newborns and young infants results in persisting enhancement of normal structures for up to several hours following injection. The prolonged half-life thus provides an increased window of time for performing imaging in these patients. For example, a sedated infant who awakes during contrast infusion may be removed from the imager, re-sedated, and re-imaged within 1-2 hours without the need for injection of additional gadolinium. Alternatively, if only a postcontrast study is desired, the infant may be sedated and given the contrast infusion while still in the neonatal care unit, and then may undergo nonurgent MR imaging. Persistent contrast enhancement in a premature neonate seen at 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after injection. The prolonged half-life (4-9 hrs) of Gd in neonates and young infants provides an expanded postcontrast imaging window. Renal excretion rates aside, neonates have twice the volume of extracellular fluid than adults have in proportion to their body weights. Therefore neonates and young infants who receive gadolinium contrast on a dose-per-kilogram basis will have blood gadolinium concentrations of only one half that in adults after equilibration. This fact argues against using a lower dose per kilogram in infants than in adults, even though the serum half-life is prolonged. Clinical experience by our group and others has demonstrated that the adult dose of gadolinium contrast (0.1 mmol/kg for most extracellular agents) is also appropriate in infants and children.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/reduced-dose-in-infants.html"}

Superparamagnetism is a property occurring principally in small, single-domain magnetic particles without magnetic memory . It is more closely related to ferromagnetism than to paramagnetism. For example, when a ferromagnetic, multidomain sample of Fe 3 O 4 is reduced in size to less than about 40 nm, a single-domain magnetic particle eventually will be formed. When placed in an external magnetic field, this particle develops a strong internal magnetization from exchange coupling of electrons within the domain and thus becomes superparamagnetic . Ferritin and hemosiderin, repositories for iron atoms released by the breakdown of hemoglobin, are naturally occurring superparamagnetic substances in tissues. Superparamagnetic ferrite particles have also been used as contrast agents for the liver and reticuloendothelial system. Because only a single domain is involved, the susceptibility of a superparamagnetic substance is not nearly as great as that of a ferromagnetic substance. Additionally, since each domain is in a separate particle, there can be no interactions or ordering of domains within a sample. Unlike ferromagnetic materials, therefore, superparamagnetic substances do not retain any net magnetization once the external field has been removed. In other words, they have no magnetic memory. Superparamagnetism and ferromagnetism are compared below: Ferrite nanoparticles, approx 35 nm diameter.

Phase-encoding is at first a somewhat difficult concept to get one's head around. Let me try to approach this in a couple of different ways. Recall that when two sine waves (A and B) with the same frequency but different phases are added together, the result is another sine wave with the same frequency but a different phase. When the sine waves are close together in phase they constructively interfere, and when out of phase they destructively interfere. The important point is this: Looking only at their sum, you simply see a sine wave of a certain frequency and phase. It is impossible from this single observation to sort out the individual contributions made by waves A and B . Interference of two sine waves of same frequency but different phases. (Courtesy of Dr. Dan Russell, Grad. Prog. Acoustics, Penn State) However, by making two observations with A and B shifted by different phases, it is possible to determine their individual contributions by looking only at their sums. This is illustrated below in an MR image, where A and B are two pixels in the same vertical column resonating at the same encoded frequency (  ). Specifically, at Step 0 (baseline, when no phase-encoding gradient is has been applied) the total signal from A&B together can be written: S o (t) = A sin t + B sin t = (A+B) sin t. In Step 1 we apply a phase encoding gradient to dephase spins along the vertical axis. After the gradient has been turned off, the signal from each pixel in the AB column now has a different phase shift, represented by the small clock face arrows. Let us ignore all the other pixels and just concentrate on A and B. Furthermore, for simplicity, let us assume that pixel A was in the zero position of the phase-encoding gradient and did not change phase, while pixel B was in a higher portion of the gradient and gained exactly 180 of phase relative to A. The signal emitted from pixel A is unchanged and equals A sin t. The signal from pixel B is now inverted and equals  B sin t. The total signal from A&B is now S 1 (t) = A sin t  B sin t = (A  B) sin t. From this single measurement in Step 1, we still do not know the individual amplitudes A and B, only their difference ( AB ). Using information from both Step 0 and Step 1 together, we are able to extract the unique signal contributions by simple algebra:  [S o + S 1 ] =  [(A+B) + (AB)] = A and  [S o  S 1 ] =  [(A+B)  (AB)] = B", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-phase-encoding.html"}

Can you explain? It is indeed true that 90and 180 pulses do not have to be used to generate a spin echo. In fact, pulses with any flip angles can be used. In his original description of spin echoes, Hahn employed a 90-90 pair of RF-pulses. When pulses other than 90-180 are used, the resultant spin echo is sometimes differentiated by calling it a Hahn echo (though many authors consider all echoes to be Hahn echoes). The reason 90-180 pairs are most commonly used is that this combination produces the maximum possible echo signal. The maximum SE intensity of a 90-90 pair is only half as large as that produced by a 90-180 pair. In general, if the first RF-pulse has flip angle  1 and the second has flip angle  2 , the maximum signal intensity of the Hahn echo will be smaller than the conventional (90-180) echo by a factor of (sin  1 )  (sin  2 / 2 ). The diagram to the below provides an introduction as to some of the interesting phenomena occurring during a 90-90-echo sequence. The first two drawings in the left column show the expected effect of the initial 90-pulse and T2*-dephasing. For illustrative purposes we have selected four spins ( a , b , c , and d ) that have slightly dephased due to local field inhomogeneities. Spins a and c are in local fields lower than B o , are precessing slightly slower than the Larmor frequency, and are losing phase. Spins b and d are in local fields higher than B o , precessing faster, and gaining phase. Moreover, we have picked the spin pairs ( a-b ) and ( c-d ) to have local field offsets of the same magnitude but opposite polarities, so they gain or lose phase relative to their partner at the same relative rates. The third drawing (bottom left) shows the effect of the second 90-pulse. W e will first focus our attention on spins a and b which, by chance, have just reached the  x and + x axes at the time of the second 90-pulse. By virtue of their unique positions along the  x axes, these spins will not be affected by the second 90-pulse. They will continue precessing in the transverse plane and at the expected time (TE = 2 x the interpulse delay) will completely rephase and form a tiny echo along the  y axis. But what about spins c and d that were lagging a and b and didn't make it all the way to the  x axes at the time of the second 90-pulse? In fact, nearly all of the spins in the sample will be more like c and d (rather than the special case of a and b lying along the x -axes). After the second 90-pulse, spins c and d now lie in the vertical ( xz -) plane. Each can be considered to have independent vector components along the x - and z -axes respectively that will be denoted by c x , c z , d x , and d z . Note that each component will be smaller than c and d though their vector sum will be of the same magnitude. At the time of the second 90-pulse the x -components ( c x and d x ) are aligned along the  x axes, just like a and b . Over time c x and d x will continue to precess in the horizontal ( xy -) plane and eventually rephase. But because they are precessing more slowly than a and b this rephasing will occur at a time later than the time when a and b rephase. The magnitude of the c x -d x \"mini-echo\" will also be smaller than the a-b mini-echo, because c x and d x are smaller than a and b . Because most paired spins (like c and d ) are precesing in planes parallel to the main (xy-plane) after the second 90-pulse and come back into phase at sligtly different times depending on their phase shifts, Hahn referred to this refocusing pattern as the \"eight-ball\" echo .

Three dimensional animation of spins after a Hahn 90-90 pair of RF-pulses courtesy of Dr. Dan Gallichan Finally, whatever happened to the z-components ( c z and d z )? Because, by definition, these are perfectly aligned with the z-axis (and B o field) they do not precess but remain locked in their vertical positions and are considered \"stored\". If a third RF-pulse were applied, c z and d z would have components tipped back into the transverse plane where they would again precess, rephase, and generate an echo. This is the origin of the stimulated echo (STE) discussed in the next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/90deg-90deg-hahn-echo.html"}

Advances in gradient and digital data acquisition technology have made it possible to obtain individual MR slices in the time frame of 50-100 msec, thus minimizing the effects of patient motion. Generically, this acquisition mode is known as echo-planar imaging (EPI) . Although EPI may seem like a recent development, the technique is among the oldest methods of spatial localization in MRI, first described by Mansfield in 1977. Mansfield's group produced the first biologic EPI images of a beating rabbit heart in 1981 and of an infant human heart in 1983. One of their early EPI techniques ( MBEST ) which became relatively popular in the 1980's is diagrammed below. Following a spin-preparation module (which might be as simple as a single RF-pulse), a strong switched frequency-encoding gradient was applied simultaneously with an intermittently \"blipped\" low-magnitude phase-encoding gradient. Gradient echoes (GREs) were collected with each oscillation of the readout (frequency) gradient. Modulus-blipped echo-planar single-pulse technique (MBEST), one of the early EPI sequences. The end result was a \"zig-zag\" traversal of k -space. The first downward-going frequency-and phase-encoding lobes imparted initial negative phase shifts to all spins, moving the signal from the middle of k -space to the far left bottom corner to a point we have previously identified as ( k x max , k y max ). Subsequent positive and negative frequency-encoding lobes swept k -space from left-to-right and right-to-left respectively. Meanwhile, the blipped low-amplitude phase-encoding gradient pulses produced a step-wise increase along the k y -axis. Zig-zag traversal of k -space from MBEST Frequency-encoding is along horizontal axis; phase-encoding is along the vertical. As originally defined, echo planar imaging referred to a sequence in which data from all of k -space for an entire 2D plane was collected following a single RF-excitation pulse. More recently the term has been expanded to include any rapid gradient-echo or spin-echo sequence in which k -space is traversed in one or a small number of excitations. In the modern lexicon these are termed single shot EPI and multi-shot EPI , respectively. Some additional vendor-specific terminology accompanies these concepts. The number of k -space lines (echoes) collected in a single shot is called the \"Echo Train Length (ETL)\" by GE and Canon; the \"EPI factor\" by SIemens and Philips; and the \"shot factor\" by Hitachi. The regions of k -space divided up by each shot of a multi-shot sequence are called segments . Hence it is common to refer to lines (or views) per segment as a measure of the intensity of k -space coverage. In a very broad sense, a fast (turbo) spin-echo sequence with a very high turbo factor/ETL could be considered a multi-shot EPI sequence. The HASTE/SS-FSE technique is an example of this.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/echo-planar-imaging.html"}

STimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) is a spectroscopic technique using three slice-selective 90-pulses applied concurrently with three orthogonal gradients ( x , y and z). The STEAM signal is a stimulated echo (STE) derived only from protons that have experienced all 3 RF-pulses. These protons are located in a cuboid-shaped voxel where the three planes overlap. Simplified diagram of the STEAM SVS sequence for MRS. Methods for water and fat suppression are described in separate Q&A's. The time of appearance of the STE depends on the spacing of the three RF-pulses. If the first two pulses are separated by time TE/2 , the peak of the STE will occur precisely at TE/2 after the third RF-pulse. The interval between the second and third pulses, TM , is called the mixing time , which is usually kept at a minimum. During this period the magnetization is \"stored\" along the z -axis and does not undergo T2 decay. Thus the echo time (TE) for the sequence is defined as TE/2 + TE/2 and does not include TM . STEAM holds several advantages compared to PRESS. First, the sequence TE can be made very short (down to ~7 msec in practice), allowing detection of short T2 metabolites. Secondly, the exclusive use of 90- (rather than 180-) pulses allows for sharper slice profiles (  better voxel edge definition), higher bandwidth (  less chemical shift displacement artifact), and lower tissue energy deposition ( smaller SARs). Notwithstanding these advantages, STEAM has a major signal-to-noise penalty based on the fact that stimulated echoes (instead of a spin echoes) are used. At the same TR's and TE's , the maximum signal from STEAM is only half as large as from PRESS. For this reason alone, STEAM has continually lost popularity over the last decade, especially for H spectroscopy at 3.0T and below.

Parallel and \"regular\" MR imaging share the common feature of multiple receiver coils, but process the information completely differently. Consider the simplified receiver array pictured below consisting of two coils (#1 and #2) placed on either side of the head. As expected, the signal received from each surface coil is strongest nearest the coil and drops off with distance. In \"regular\" MR imaging we can combine data from each surface coil to produce a composite image of the brain at full field-of-view (FOV). This arrangement may provide improved signal-to-noise and spatial resolution compared to that obtainable from a single large head coil, but produces no gain in speed. Too few phase-encoding (PE) steps in PI results in aliasing, with the left side of the brain (b) wrapping around to the right side (a), and vice-versa. Here the PE direction is left-to-right. To shorten imaging time in PI the number of phase-encoding steps are reduced. For speed to be doubled at constant resolution, only half of the lines of k -space are acquired. This strategy, however, results in an insufficient number of spatial frequencies collected to adequately represent the imaged object. A reduced FOV and aliasing (\"wrap-around\") is seen in the reconstructed image. Wrap-around and reduced FOV also occur in data obtained from the individual surface coils (#1 and #2). Routine image reconstruction (as done with \"regular\" MRI) would result in a mess of overlapping edges and shadows due to uncorrected aliasing. The fundamental problem is PI is how to \"unfold\" this data using information about the coils themselves. In the frequency domain, an equivalent problem exists  how to estimate the missing lines of k -space and avoid aliasing wrap-around. Two basic strategies have been developed to correct for the aliasing overlap in PI images. In the first method (SENSE, ASSET), images from the individual coils are reconstructed and correction is performed in the spatial/image domain. The second group of methods (GRAPPA, ARC) operate in the frequency domain; data is corrected in k -space before reconstruction. Both techniques are described in detail in subsequent Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-is-pi-different.html"}

GRASE brain image accentuating low signal in the basal ganglia due to iron accumulation in PKAN syndrome The acronym GRASE stands for  G radient A nd S pin E cho. It is a hybrid technique that generates and records a series of alternately acquired gradient echoes and spin echoes from a train of RF-pulses. In its original implementation, a 90-RF pulse was followed by series of eight 180-refocusing pulses, generating eight spin echoes. Centered about (and overlapping) each spin echo, three gradient echoes were produced by rapidly switching the readout gradient polarity. The final data set consisted of 24 separate MR signals having properties intermediate between spin-echo and gradient echo contrast. The putative advantage of GRASE is that the gradient echo component would provide increased sensitivity for detecting calcifications and hemorrhages (often difficult to see on SE) while not having too much susceptibility artifact at normal anatomic interfaces. Additionally the energy deposition ( Specific Absorption Rate, SAR ) is lower than a comparable fast spin-echo sequence because there are fewer RF-pulses. More modern implementations of this sequence allow adjustment of the relative numbers of GREs and SEs used. As such the relative degree of T2- vs T2*-weighting can be controlled. In spite of its initial promise, GRASE has never really taken hold as a standard imaging protocol, although it is still offered as an option on most scanners and seems to enjoy some popularity at Philips sites.

It is immediately adjacent to and functionally related to primary somatosensory cortex , occupying the the postcentral gyrus of the anterior parietal lobe. Surgery in and around this region carries a high risk of paralysis and loss of function. Hence motor cortex mapping is the most widely used preoperative application of fMRI today. Primary motor cortex Cortical sensory homunculus Because of their strong interconnections, these two areas are often jointly referred to as the primary sensorimotor cortex . The functions of the sensorimotor cortex are organized spatially as a homunculus (\"little man\"), with lower extremity projections superior-medially, followed by trunk, arm, hand, and face more inferior-laterally. Just anterior to the sensorimotor cortex a supplementary motor area is commonly described, thought to be involved in the planning and sequencing of movement. In fMRI motor paradigms both the ipsilateral thalamus and contralateral cerebellum will often exhibit activity, thought to reflect their roles in coordination and motor memory. BOLD-fMRI maps obtained during performance of right-sided finger tapping. The contralateral (left-side) primary sensorimotor cortex is most strongly activated.

Individual slices in an fMRI acquisition commonly suffer from random variations in average signal intensity, noise spikes, ghosts, and data glitches. These may result from physiological sources (patient motion, respiration, cardiac pulsations, anxiety, drowsiness, drugs) or from the scanner itself (field inhomogeneities, eddy currents, gradient heating, electronics).

Compressed sensing (CS) refers to a group of methods for accelerated MR data acquisition based on semi-random, incomplete sampling of k -space. A final image is created through an iterative optimization process using non-Fourier transformation and thresholding of intermediately reconstructed images. Although still relatively early in development, CS methods appear especially promising for MRA , 3D/4D MRI, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) studies, and cardiac MR imaging applications. Their utility has been recently expanded by incorporation of deep learning models that improve reconstruction accuracy and reduce computational time. Cine cardiac study using compressed sensing with acceleration factors up to 15-fold. (Adapted from Abascal et al under CC BY) Most readers will be aware that file size of photos can be reduced as much as 10:1 while maintaining good quality using a format like jpeg . Such compression is possible because photographic (as well as MR) images contain many pixels lacking unique information content (e.g., those in the background with zero intensity and those with nearly the same values as their neighbors). This leads directly to the ingenious idea underlying CS MRI: If MR images can be compressed after reconstruction, why not save time up front and only collect only the \"essential\" components of the MR signal rather than all k -space data? To successfully accomplish this, three factors are required: incoherent undersampling, sparsifying transformation, and iterative reconstruction. Incoherent Undersampling The term undersampling means that only a portion of k -space is measured, thus allowing significant reduction in data acquisition times. However, this undersampling must be performed in an incoherent (semi-random) manner. Data undersampling in a coherent (predictable) pattern, such as selecting every 3rd line of k -space, creates discrete aliasing \"ghost\" artifacts that would wrap over the image. By sampling irregularly, these artifacts are instead distributed as diffuse noise across the entire image that can later be removed. At the same time, data sampling cannot be too random, because the center of k -space contains more \"essential\" image information than its periphery. Accordingly, most current CS approaches (variable density Poisson disk, Gaussian, and Golden-angle radial) employ semi -random acquisition of data with preferential sampling near the k -space center. Sparsifying Transformation Sparsity reflects the extent to which an imaging matrix is filled with meaningful data. Some matrices are intrinsically sparse, such as those associated with MRAs, containing mostly zeros (corresponding to black/nonvascular regions). Images of solid organs may not appear sparse in their conventional display, but can be mathematically transformed/decomposed into representations having relatively sparse components. The application of so-called sparsifying transforms (such as wavelets ) are an essential feature of CS reconstruction methods described below. MRA - an intrinsically sparse image Brain MRI - not intrinsically sparse Relatively sparse wavelet components (From Zhao et al under CC BY) Iterative Reconstruction Unlike single-step Fourier reconstruction of conventional MR images, Compressed Sensing involves multiple steps and data transformations, mediated by an iterative optimization algorithm repeated dozens of times, following a scheme something like this : Collect initial k-space data using limited, incoherent (semi-random) sampling. Fourier transform this data to create an initial image . The initial image will be very crude, suffering from diffuse aliasing artifacts manifest as \"noise\". Apply a sparsifying transform (such as wavelet decomposition) that will concentrate meaningful imaging characteristics into a smaller number of high-intensity pixels. The aliasing \"noise\" will now be of lower intensity and distributed over many pixels, most in the background. Remove aliasing (\" denoise \") the sparsified data by zeroing out pixels with values below a minimum threshold, digital filtering, and/or subtraction. Apply inverse sparsifying and Fourier transforms to reconvert this \" denoised \" data back into k -space format. Create a k -space \" difference matrix \" by subtracting the original from the denoised k -space data and setting all other points to zero. By Fourier transformation, a \" difference image \" can then be created. Add the initial and difference images together to create an \" updated image \". Compare the initial and updated images . If significant disparity is present, repeat Steps 3-7. Otherwise Stop.

The principal H spectral peak arising from of the normal prostate comes from citrate . Citrate is secreted by prostatic epithelial cells into ejaculatory fluid in high concentrations. Its role is not fully known, but is believed to activate sperm cells and increase their motility. High-resolution laboratory spectroscopy reveals citrate to be an AB quartet centered at  = 2.6 ppm deriving from its four central hydrogens. In clinical exams this fine structure cannot be appreciated but a slightly notched citrate peak may be sometimes recognized at 3T. The relative size and appearance of these peaks is strongly dependent on the pulse sequence, field strength, and TE , so care must be taken in choosing optimal parameters for the detection of citrate in clinical MRS. Hi-resolution spectrum of citrate reveals an \"AB quartet\" centered at about  = 2.6 ppm. H-spectrum of normal prostate at 3.0T. Slight notching of the dominant citrate (Cit) peak at  = 2.6 ppm is noted. Other resonances include choline (Cho, 3.2 ppm), creatine (Cr, 3.0 ppm), and polyamines (PA, 3.1 ppm) In addition to the dominant citrate resonance, small peaks for choline (Cho, at  = 3.2 ppm) and creatine (Cr, at  = 3.0 ppm) are regularly observed in the normal gland. These peaks often appear joined, being bridged by a broad peak from polyamines (PA) . In prostate cancer, citrate levels fall (due to consumption of citrate to supply energy to proliferating cells), while choline levels increase (corresponding to increased cell membrane synthesis). This pattern is similar to the reversal of the NAA/choline ratio seen in malignant brain tumors. Additionally, cancer causes a decrease in polyamine levels, so a more obvious separation of the Cho and Cr peaks can often be observed. Jung et al have developed a 5-tier scoring system to aid with interpretation of prostate spectra and improve interobserver accuracy for the diagnosis of malignancy. H-MRS showing a normal spectrum on the right side of the prostate and cancer on the left. Note the decrease in citrate (Ci) and elevation of choline (Cho) in the cancerous side, with a Jung score = 5. Decrease in polyamines (PA) in cancer also allow better separation of the Cho and Cr peaks to be appreciated. (Modified from Sharma 2014, under CC BY license) Knowledge of prostatic zonal anatomy is necessary to properly interpret these spectra. Specifically, the central and transition zones, anterior fibromuscular band, and periurethral tissues have much lower citrate levels than seen in the normal peripheral zone. Conversely, tissues surrounding the seminal vesicles, urethra, and ejaculatory ducts have relatively high Cho levels due to the presence of glycerophosphocholine in the the fluid they contain. The diagnostician must also be aware of other pitfalls including confounding effects of coexistent benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostatitis, lipid contamination, and post-biopsy changes on the spectra observed.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/prostate-spectra.html"}

The same gradient reversal process used to create a single gradient echo can be repeated to produce two or more additional GREs after a single RF-pulse. This is known as dual (or multi-) echo GRE . Generating multiple GREs is possible as long as complete loss of the transverse magnetization by T2* relaxation has not yet occurred. As shown in the diagram, the second half of the first upward gradient lobe dephases the signal. The first half of the second downward lobe rephases these spins and generates a second echo. The process may be repeated, but because of T2*-decay, the maximum usable number of echoes is only 3-4 in most cases. The echo times for each echo are different and commonly denoted TE1 , TE2 , etc. A multi-echo GRE sequence. The first half of the larger gradient lobes rephase (Re) the signal.

This non-contrast MRA technique is particularly suitable for peripheral angiography. The core sequence is a T2-weighted 3D-fast (turbo) spin-echo accelerated using partial Fourier acquisition. The sequence is cardiac gated either to the EKG or peripheral pulse. Co-registered images are obtained in diastole and systole, and then subtracted to produce an arteriogram. The idea is straightforward and was first proposed in the 1980s, but has only become practical in the modern era with faster gradients and pulse sequences. During diastole, the signal in both arteries and veins is high reflecting the long T2 of blood. During systole, venous signal remains high but arterial signal drops due to flow-related signal loss. Subtraction of the systolic from the diastolic images results in a pure arterial image. Gated FSE MRA of the distal femoral artery. In diastole (left image), the arterial signal (a) is relatively high, while in systole (middle image) a dark arterial flow void occurs. Intermediate (gray) signal from the adjacent femoral vein (v) remains relatively constant at all phases of the cardiac cycle. Subtracting the systolic from the diastolic image removes the vein as well as most of the soft tissues, providing an arterial image (right). In addition to imaging peripheral arteries, gated 3D-FSE MRA can also be used for imaging the major vessels of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. If only gross anatomic information about the aorta or major thoracic vessels is needed, a single diastolic image may suffice as nearby venous enhancement will not significantly affect image quality. The technique is useful for non-contrast pulmonary arteriography as the FSE method minimizes susceptibility-induced dephasing at air-vascular interfaces. Gated 3D-FSE MRA subtraction image of the pelvic vessels. Gated-3D-FSE MRA image of the chest using only a single diastolic measurement without subtraction As with all other sequences, a vendor-specific nomenclature exists. Perhaps the most elaborate acronym is Siemens' NATIVE SPACE (\"Non-contrast MRA of ArTerIes and VEins using Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution.\") GE's version is called Inhance Deltaflow (\"Delta\" refers to the fact that a difference image is obtained). Philips uses the acronym TRANCE (\" TRiggered Angiography Non-Contrast Enhanced). Hitachi calls their method VASC-FSE (\"Veins and Arteries Sans Contrast-Fast Spin Echo\"), while Canon uses the acronyms FBI (\"Fresh Blood Imaging\") and CIA (\"Contrast-free Improved Angiography\"). The main advantage of 3D-FSE MRA is that it does not require contrast, a property that may be important in patients with renal insufficiency (where receiving gadolinium might place them at risk for nerphogenic systemic fibrosis ). If contrast administration is not contraindicated, however, then a contrast-enhanced MRA is generally preferable because of higher image quality and faster imaging times. A major disadvantage of 3D-FSE, particularly for peripheral MRA, occurs when flow is sluggish or highly stenotic lesions are present. In such situations the pulse wave is damped and the difference in arterial signal between systole and diastole is minimal, resulting in poor arterial contrast on the MRA. Timing of the acquisitions can also be tricky, as the peak systolic wave may arrive in the two extremities at different times. This may require collecting several sets of images at different delay times in different parts of each extremity. In brief, 3D-FSE MRA works great in normal volunteers, but the results may prove unsatisfactory in patients with significant vascular disease. Other disadvantages of 3D-FSE MRA include: 1) obscuring vessel wall abnormalities such as intramural hematomas and dissections due to the subtraction process; 2) overestimation of stenoses caused by imperfect timing of the triggered acquisitions; 3) gross motion and vascular pulsation artifacts; 4) sensitivity to cardiac arrhythmias; and 5) spatial blurring due to T2-decay during the rapid FSE echo train. The technique is not well suited for carotid imaging because rapid flow in the jugular vein often contaminates the subtraction images. Likewise the gated 3D-FSE method does not work well where orthogonal directions of arterial flow occur, such as between the aorta and renal or mesenteric arteries.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gated-3d-fse-mra.html"}

SPAMM (SPAtial Modulation of Magnetization) is a technique where RF-saturation pulses are used to place stripes or grids on the heart to follow its motion during the cardiac cycle. The images obtained are typically displayed in a cine format, allowing for both visual and quantitative assessments of wall motion. In current practice SPAMM is used for clinical applications where information is needed about myocardial contractility. Such situations occur in the setting of focal myocardial ischemia or infiltrative disorders that produce regional wall motion abnormalities not reflected in global quantitative measurements such as ejection fraction or end diastolic volume. SPAMM technique, short-axis view Three sets of short-axis images (basal, mid-ventricular, and apical) are typically acquired, plus a long-axis, 4-chamber view. A rectangular grid pattern is used for the short-axis views, while a simple stripe pattern is often preferred for long-axis images. The data is then transferred to a separate workstation for advanced post-processing. Semi-automated software is available for calculating parameters such as peak strain timing, circumferential and radial strain components, and twist angle. Such measurements are routinely performed only at the most sophisticated cardiac MR centers, however. More commonly, only a visual assessment of cardiac wall motion based on perceived motion of tags is conducted. SPAMM technique for producing parallel saturation band across an image. The simplest form of SPAMM producing a series of parallel stripes is illustrated in the diagram left. Here we have applied two rectangular (hard, non-slice-selective) 45-pulses followed by an image acquisition sequence. The imaging sequence is arbitrary, but is usually a 2D cardiac-gated SSFP or similar bright blood technique. Sandwiched between the RF-pulses is tagging gradient followed by a large spoiler gradient . The diagram below illustrates how the tagging process operates. Let us assume that before the SPAMM sequence is initiated, the magnetization ( M ) of the myocardium is in steady-state equilibrium and directed along the z -axis. The first 45-tagging pulse rotates M in the yz -plane. Application of the tagging gradient disperses these spins in the transverse ( xy ) plane, modulating their phases as a function of position similar to that which occurs during application of a conventional imaging gradient. The tagging gradient is of sufficient size to cause the spin phases to wrap many times around 360. (These phase cycles will be transformed into z-axis modulation and SPAMM stripes during the next two steps.) Spin evolution in the SPAMM technique The second RF-pulse tips the entire ensemble of dephased spins by another 45. These doubly rotated spins now lie along an obliquely oriented cone with both longitudinal and transverse components. In the final step the transverse components of these spins will be destroyed by endogenous T2 decay and the large spoiler gradient. This leaves only residual longitudinal ( z -) magnetization components whose magnitudes vary in a sinusoidal pattern reflecting the original transverse phase dispersion. When the imaging module is performed, these spatial variations in magnetization will be translated into bands of oscillating signal intensity across the image. The SPAMM sequence pictured above produces a single set of stripes parallel to the tagged gradient axis. To create a grid, a second set of RF-pulses and gradients must be applied in an orthogonal direction. SPAMM grid requires 2 sets of pulses & gradients The width and spacing of bands depends in a complicated manner on the area under the tagging gradient as well as the flip angles of the RF-pulses. In common practice, the RF-pulses used for SPAMM are not simple 45-pulses but a series of closely-spaced composite pulses of the binomial type (see related Q&A ). Fading of SPAMM tags late in cardiac cycle Because of T1-recovery SPAMM tags tend to fade late in the cardiac cycle. By end-systole, tag lines may merge or become indistinct as shown in the figure. This phenomenon may be minimized by using a low flip angle (~10) for the SSFP imaging portion. Improved persistence of tag lines may also be obtained by increasing flip angles of the RF-tagging pulses or by using composite (binomial) RF-pulses.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/taggingspamm.html"}

As its name implies, MR Imaging (MRI) is primarily concerned with the production of anatomic images . MRI scans usually contain many thousands of voxels whose signals reflect the bulk magnetic properties (e.g., T1, T2, susceptibility, flow) of the tissues they contain. The signals of interest recorded by MRI come predominantly from protons in water and fat. By comparison, the goal of MR Spectroscopy (MRS) is to analyze the chemical composition of tissues in a very small number of much larger voxels. By excluding the overwhelming signals from water and fat, MRS can detect small metabolites existing in millimolar (mM) concentrations. These metabolites can be differentiated because they resonate at slightly different frequencies based on their local chemical environments. The degree of frequency separation between two molecular species is characterized by their chemical shift () , a small number displayed on the horizontal axis below their spectra.

Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) is superficially similar to proton decoupling in that it involves selective RF-irradiation of H nuclei leading to improved peak definition in a P spectrum. Indeed, both proton decoupling and NOE are usually performed together in the same MRS experiment. Three important differences should be noted, however: The NOE effect is due to a dipolar (through space) interaction of P and H spins, while decoupling is mediated by J-coupling (through bonds). RF-irradiation of protons in NOE is performed in the period before P signal acquisition, while decoupling is performed during signal acquisition. NOE is a spin-lattice (T1) process that takes time to develop; decoupling is instantaneous. The mechanism underlying NOE is somewhat complex, hopefully made more understandable by the video (left). In brief, saturating the H resonance in a system where protons undergo dipolar interactions with P nuclei upsets the thermodynamic balance between up and down spin states. As the population difference in H spins driven to zero by RF-saturation, the population difference of P increases in response, with augmentation of P signal. In theory, maximum enhancement of 120% is possible, but in practice 40-80% values are typical. As with proton decoupling, both continuous wave (narrowband) and pulsed block (broadband) RF-irradiation schemes (e.g. WALTZ-4) are possible.

The use of negative frequencies to describe common physical phenomena like sound waves is generally unnecessary. For example, it is perfectly adequate to say that \"middle C\" has a frequency of 261.63 Hz or that the voltage from an electrical outlet alternates at 60 Hz. In these cases we consider frequency to be single scalar value without sign, sometimes called the temporal frequency . In other situations it is more appropriate to think of frequency as a vector quantity possessing both magnitude and direction. Consider two wheels rotating at the same revolutions per minute (rpm's) but in opposite directions. In this scenario it would be reasonable to assign positive and negative angular frequencies (+  and   ) to distinguish clockwise from counter-clockwise motion. Distinguishing positive from negative frequencies becomes important in Fourier analysis. The reason is that the Fourier transform doesn't just break up a signal into simple positive sinusoids. It actually decomposes the signal into complex exponentials that can be thought of as sine and cosine waves rotating in both directions. For an additional perspective on negative versus positive frequencies, recall that frequency (  ) is also the rate of change of phase (  ) with respect to time ( t ), expressed in calculus by the expression  = d /dt. (This makes sense because the units of frequency are expressed in cycles, degrees, or radians per second ). Hence a positive frequency (+  ) means that phase is increasing with time, while a negative frequency (  ) implies that phase is decreasing with time. The  k x and  k y axes thus correspond to negative spatial frequencies and decreasing phase accumulation. In general, a negative polarity gradient lobe winds spatial frequencies and phases to the left or bottom of the diagram (depending along which axis it is applied). Conversely, a positive gradient lobe winds frequencies and phases upward and to the right.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/negative-frequencies.html"}

Time-resolved CE-MRA (Courtesy Siemens) Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) is similar to contrast-enhanced CT angiography, except a gadolinium-based agent (instead of an iodine compound) is injected. Just as iodine produces x-ray attenuation allowing visualization of vessels on CTA, gadolinium shortens the T1 of blood rendering vessels bright on CE-MRA. Flow-related phenomena (e.g., velocities, flow direction, turbulence)  factors that play dominant roles in the appearance of vessels on non-contrast MRA studies  have little or no effect on CE-MRA where vascular signal intensity is determined principally the the concentration of gadolinium within the vessel. The gadolinium-based contrast agent is injected intravenously, usually into a central catheter or antecubital vein. In an average-sized adult with normal renal function, about 20 mL of contrast is administered over 8-12 sec, followed by a saline flush (\" chaser \") of another 20-30 mL. The goal is to inject a compact bolus of contrast into the central circulation with clearing of all contrast from the proximal veins. The injection of contrast (and saline) can be performed by hand. This can be done using two syringes and a stop-cock, or with a single syringe loaded with (denser) gadolinium on the bottom and (lighter) saline on top. More commonly power injectors using two syringes remotely controlled from the scanner console are employed. During its passage through the heart and lungs, the contrast agent becomes progressively diluted. For example, if the gadolinium contrast injected into the arm has a concentration of 500 mM, by the time it has reached the carotid arteries its concentration has fallen to less than 10 mM. Medrad dual power injector This concentration of gadolinium is still adequate to cause significant T1-shortening of blood. However, relatively little margin for error exists. Ideally, CE-MRA should be performed when the contrast agent arrives in the vessel at or near its peak concentration. Calculating the peak arrival time of the contrast bolus is important and described in the next Q&A . Scanning too early or too late may result in missing the passage of the contrast bolus and inadequate vascular visualization. Scanning too late also has a second drawback  overlapping veins may have time fill, obscuring arterial anatomy. Single-phase CE-MRA Once the contrast bolus arrives in the vessel of interest, imaging is typically performed using a rapid 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo pulse sequence. TR and TE are generally made as short as possible, and gradient-moment nulling is not used. A wide receiver bandwidth (equivalent to short sampling time) is typically employed in conjunction with partial k -space acquisition and parallel imaging. Two different acquisition modes are available. Single-phase methods capture a vascular images at a single point in time. Time-resolved methods repeatedly acquire views of the imaging volume as contrast passes through the regional circulation. Bolus-chase methods combine table movement with imaging to follow the contrast distally into the extremities. After gadolinium, fat is the next brightest substance in the image, so some form of fat suppression is typically used during the course of the CE-MRA sequence. Fat suppression pulse(s) need not be played out for each individual image in a multi-image series, but must occur on a regular basis within the cycle (e.g., once for every slice-encoding loop). Image quality can be further improved by image subtraction, where a noncontrast (\" mask \") image is subtracted from each postcontrast image. Complex (vector) subtraction techniques taking into account both phase and magnitude data are preferred. CE-MRA sequences using the Dixon method for fat suppression have also been developed, but are limited by Bo inhomogeneity effects. Over the last decade, CE-MRA has become the method of choice for evaluating most of vascular systems within the body due to its intrinsically high signal-to-noise, spatial resolution, and relative freedom from flow-related artifacts. The principal limitations result from the use of gadolinium contrast itself, which may be contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency or allergies. Like CTA, you only have a single chance to get CE-MRA right; if the time of the peak bolus is mis-judged, the MRA may be ruined with inadequate arterial filling and contaminating contrast present in the the venous system or urinary tract.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/contrast-enhanced-mra.html"}

At most clinical cardiac MR centers today, only qualitative (visual) assessment of myocardial perfusion is commonly performed. Perfusion defects (hypoenhancement) for each cardiac segment are typically graded into one of five categories based on transmural extent: no defect, defect <25%, 2550%, 5075%, or defect >75%. Regional areas of hypoenhancement exceeding 25% in any segment are generally considered to be pathological (inducible perfusion deficits). Quantification of myocardial perfusion is indeed possible, but is technically demanding, subject to errors, and requires considerable post-processing time. As such, it is largely confined to research centers and has not yet attained \"mainstream\" status for routine clinical care. To be done properly, quantification of myocardial perfusion requires the following constraints and assumptions: Signal intensity should be proportional to gadolinium concentration . In reality, some departure from direct proportionality is expected. The degree of non-linearity is dependent on the absolute concentration of gadolinium, field strength, pulse sequence, type of magnetization preparation, inversion time, and k -space ordering. A half-dose (0.05 mmol/kg) or less of gadolinium contrast should be used to avoid T2*-shortening and underestimation of myocardial blood flow. Corrections for surface-coil and RF-nonuniformities .

B 1 -field nonuniformity of excitation results in spatially-dependent flip angles. The use of adiabatic (BIR-4), notched, or composite RF-pulses may be needed, especially at 3T and higher. Modeling of myocardial structure . The simplest analysis considers the myocardium a single compartment that accumulates gadolinium based on inflow and outflow rates in accordance with Zierler's Central Volume Principle (a generalization of Fick's Principle ). More commonly, a two-compartment model is used, dividing the myocardium into vascular and interstitial spaces. More complex models have been developed, including those considering (a) fast water exchange with a third (intracellular) compartment, and (b) spatially-dependent variations of gadolinium concentration across the myocardium. Mathematical analysis . All mathematical analyses for perfusion require measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) , representing the changing signal intensity of blood in the LV or aorta during the first pass of gadolinium (red curve below). An assumption about the impulse response of the myocardium to the AIF must then be made (a popular choice is to describe it as a Fermi function ). Finally, a mathematical procedure known as deconvolution must be applied to estimate parameters of the model chosen, including myocardial perfusion in absolute terms (ml/min/g of tissue). Commercially available software (such as this example from CMRtools.com ) allows model-based quantification of myocardial perfusion. Here the ventricular blood pool (red) serves as the arterial input function (AIF). Semiquantitative perfusion method using the relative \"up-slopes\" of the myocardium and blood pool (dotted lines) after a Gd bolus. A quicker, semi-quantitative method for myocardial perfusion commonly employed is to measure the \" up-slope \" of signal in the myocardium during the first pass of gadolinium (dotted lines above). To account for variations in arterial bolus, a normalized myocardial perfusion slope may be obtained by dividing the myocardial uptake slope by the blood pool uptake slope. Other semi-quantitative indices are also possible (e.g., time-to-peak, mean transit time, ratio of stress-to-rest perfusion up-slopes).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/quantifying-perfusion.html"}

Machine Learning (ML) techniques are commonly divided into two classes: shallow and deep. A shallow neural network has only one or a few layers of neurons, while a deep neural network has many. The choice of shallow or deep architecture depends on the complexity of the task, amount of accessible data, and the computational resources available. Shallow Neural Network Shallow neural networks are comparatively simpler and easier to train. They are suitable for straightforward tasks such as data fitting, classification, and pattern recognition. Examples include logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, and cluster analysis as pictured below. Shallow networks can be trained quickly with fewer parameters, making them faster to train and requiring less computational resources. Deep Neural Network Deep neural networks , by comparison, have complex architectures containing multiple intervening layers, allowing them to learn more elaborate relationships between inputs and outputs. Deep learning (DL) methods are suitable for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision. Deep networks require a large amount of data to train and are computationally intensive. However, they can achieve higher accuracy and perform better than shallow networks for complex tasks. Examples of deep networks include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) , generative adversarial networks (GANs) , transformer networks , and others.

Projectile or \"missile\" events (where extraneous ferromagnetic objects are propelled into the scanner) are among the most dramatic dangers of strong magnetic fields. Fortunately, these events are rare. In a 10-year review of 1548 adverse MRI-related events reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, 133 (9%) involved projectiles. Nearly all of these were large objects including walkers, wheelchairs, stretchers, gas cylinders, carts, IV poles, and patient monitoring equipment mistakenly brought into the magnet room. My friend Moriel NessAiver has assembled an amusing collection of cases at his website, simplyphysics.com . The first 3 examples below are reproduced with his permission. These images and video, although humorous, remind us that real projectile accidents can and do occur, and we must remain forever vigilant. This is brought home by the three news items below, in which death in MR scanners occurred due to propulsion of ferromagnetic oxygen cylinders. The first unfortunate case occurred in New York in 2001, when the head of a 6-year-old boy was crushed by an oxygen tank that flew into the scanner while he was being scanned. The second death occurred in Mumbai in 2018, when a 32-year man brought his family member's oxygen tank into the magnet room. He was pulled into the scanner and pinned there by the cylinder which ruptured on impact. Death was due to inhalation of liquid oxygen and subsequent tension pneumothorax. The third MRI-related death, also by an oxygen tank, occurred in Gimhae, Korea in October, 2021. MR projectile death of 6-year old boy in New York, 2001 In early 2023 a fourth MRI projectile fatality occurred in So Paulo, Brazil, where a 40-year-old lawyer died after his being shot by his own gun while accompanying his mother for an MRI. The man, a well known gun rights advocate and TikTok influencer, brought the hidden weapon into the MRI room even after having been instructed in MRI safety procedures for removal of all metal objects and signing a release. As he neared the MRI scanner the weapon was pulled from his waistband, struck the machine, and fired a bullet into his stomach. After a several week hospital stay he succumbed to his injuries. Fortunately (but more so due to a conscientious and excellent staff) we never had any type of significant projectile accident in the 30 years I ran the MRI center at Wake Forest scanning hundreds of thousands of patients. Occasionally we would discover a bobby pin or paper clip of unknown origin stuck against the scanner bore in at servicing, but nothing more significant. Our only serious projectile incident did not involve patients or medical personnel, but occurred after hours when a maintenance engineer was working on the scanner. He carried a piece of (unrecognized) ferromagnetic flashing into the scanner room and was injured when the sharp edge of the metal cut into him as it was pulled into the magnet. The engineer suffered an upper abdominal wall and superficial liver laceration from the projectile event, but recovered fully.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/projectiles.html"}

The answer is NO to both questions. Parallel imaging (PI) is not a pulse sequence, but an imaging reconstruction technique. It is an option that can be used with virtually every type of pulse sequence (SE, GRE, DWI, IR, MRA, etc). PI exploits differences in spatial and/or frequency sensitivities of two or more receiver coils whose outputs can be independently recorded, digitized, and processed. Typically, arrays containing 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or more coils are employed. PI therefore cannot not be used with just a single surface, head, knee, or large body coil having only one pair of quadrature output channels. The allowed direction(s) in which PI can be performed depends on the arrangement of coils in the array. Specifically, the coils must should have different sensitivity profiles along the direction chosen for PI. For spinal imaging, the receiver coils are typically arrayed in a linear fashion along the middle of the spine from head to the coccyx. Maximal coil sensitivity differences exist from superior-inferior (S-I), which is the standard direction chosen for parallel imaging. PI is performed in the S-I direction for spinal imaging The illustrations below show two possible head receiver coil configurations. On the left the coils all have similar sensitivity profiles in the S-I direction, but their profiles are significantly different in the left-right (L-R) and anterior-posterior (A-P) directions. Hence PI could be used in either the L-R or A-P (but not S-I) directions. The multi-element coil array on the right has no such restriction. PI is possible in the L-R or A-P directions only PI possible in all three directions", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/pi-coils-and-sequences.html"}

RF-transmission requires a separate field (B1) rotating/oscillating near the proton resonant (Larmor) frequency directed perpendicularly to the main magnetic field (Bo). To stimulate the NMR spin system, an RF-coil must produce a time-varying excitation field B 1 (t) with the following characteristics:  B 1 (t) must have components that rotate near the resonant frequency (  o ), and  B 1 (t) must have components perpendicular to the static magnetic field ( B o ) The simplest form of such an RF-transmit coil is a single loop oriented at right angles to the main magnetic field (see figure right). By driving a sinusoidal alternating current through this loop at the Larmor frequency, an oscillating magnetic field perpendicular to Bo is produced. Somewhat more sophisticated variations of this coil can be easily imagined, such as 2-loop (Helmholz) or multi-loop (solenoid) configurations. Single loop RF-coil Helmholz coil configuration Solenoid coil configuration Because they generate an oscillating B 1 field in only a single dimension, single-loop, Helmholz, and solenoid RF-coils are called l inearly polarized (LP) . Although not immediately obvious, this configuration is highly inefficient for MRI in that half of the transmitted power is wasted. Some insight into the nature and inefficiency of linear polarization can be appreciated by considering the diagram below. Here you can see that a field like B 1 (depicted as a big green arrow) oscillating at the resonance frequency (  o ) can be decomposed into two counterrotating subfields (red and blue arrows), each half as large. One of these subfields (red arrow) rotates in the same direction and frequency (  o ) as the spins undergoing NMR; the other subfield (blue arrow) rotates in the opposite direction and frequency (  o ). Only the subfield associated with red arrow is effective at inducing net nuclear transitions and a change in net nuclear magnetization required for MRI. The other subfield is ineffective for NMR and serves only to deposit unwanted thermal energy into tissue. A linearly oscillating B1 field (green arrow) can be considered the sum of two fields half as large (red and blue arrows) rotating in opposite directions. The blue subfield rotates opposite the spin system and is inefficient/wasted. In the 1980's linearly polarized transmit-receive RF-coils were the norm, but by the 1990's had become largely replaced by q uadrature or circularly polarized (CP) coils.

Up until now the MR signal has been treated rather informally, appearing as just a \"squiggle\" in most of our diagrams. For simplicity, I have purposely neglected dissecting the MR signal in detail. . . until now. In prior Q&A's we illustrated how the MR signal is an electrical current induced in a receiver coil following stimulation of a spin system by an RF-pulse. The recorded signal from such a pulse experiment has the form of either a free induction decay (FID) or echo . Both types of signals are high frequency oscillations at the Larmor frequency, whose amplitudes rise or fall as a result of T2 effects and magnetic field inhomogeneities. In our simple examples we tacitly considered the MR signals to have arisen from a single large voxel in a homogeneous sample without spatial encoding. The signals in MR imaging arise from multiple voxels, often from an entire slice (or slab of tissue containing many slices) recorded all at once. These voxels contain different materials with different spin densities and relaxation times. Furthermore, the main magnetic field ( B o ) has often been purposely distorted by the use of gradients to change the frequency and phase of protons as a function of spatial position. The resulting total MR signal is thus the sum of thousands of FIDs and echoes arising from individual voxels with different amplitudes, frequencies, and phases. Sorting out this huge array of overlapping and interfering signals might seem impossible, but a number of very clever techniques have been developed to do just that. Such methods (discussed in a later Q&A ) include frequency-encoding, phase-encoding, variations of signal timing, and exploiting knowledge of coil location and sensitivity. Fourier transform methods also allow the data to be sorted out according to differences in frequency and accumulated phase. Although the baseline frequency of the MR signal is very high (~64 MHz for a 1.5T scanner), the vital spatial, spectral, and relaxation information is encoded over a much smaller range, typically less than 50-100 kHz. The baseline oscillation near the Larmor frequency acts only as a carrier wave for the much lower frequency imaging information, equivalent to the way commercial radio signals are transmitted. AM stations use amplitude modulation , where the amplitude of the carrier changes with with sound level. FM stations use frequency modulation , where wave spacing encodes the audio information. Phase modulation of the MR signal also occurs and is closely related to frequency modulation. The FID pictured at the top of this Q&A is an example of a simple, amplitude modulated wave. It is composed of a carrier of the form { sin  o t } modulated by a decaying exponential e t/T2* . At a relatively early stage of MR signal processing, the high frequency carrier waves are filtered out, a process known as demodulation . This removal of the high frequency information doesn't solve the problem of figuring out what signal comes from where, but it does make the situation more manageable. After demodulation, we only need to decode spatial and spectral information where the frequencies lie in the range of a few thousand Hz (rather than across millions of Hz).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/signal-squiggles.html"}

Because of their superior T1 sensitivity, inversion recovery (IR) methods are most frequently used to identify areas of myocardial enhancement. For readers requiring a refresher, the general principles of image formation using IR techniques are more fully explored in another section of the website . Recovery of cardiac tissues after the 180-pulse is based is based on their T1 values. An MR signal is generated at the inversion time ( TI ). The standard image display method for IR uses magnitude reconstruction . Here the actual direction of M z (i.e., whether it is points in the + z or  z direction) is irrelevant. The rendered pixel intensity depends only on the magnitude of M z , not its polarity. Under magnitude reconstruction, air (and any tissue whose magnetization lies is at the zero crossing point at time TI ) appears black. This is sometimes illustrated as a \"bounce point\" diagram, shown right. As a brief review, the IR pulse sequence begins with a 180-inversion pulse that flips the net magnetization ( M ) of all tissues into the z direction. Longitudinal recovery along the + z- axis then occurs, with short T1 tissues recovering faster than long T1 tissues. After a few hundred milliseconds at the inversion time ( TI ) , an MR signal is generated. The strength of this signal for each tissue depends on its longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) at time TI . Magnitude reconstructed IR is often represented on a \"bounce point\" diagram, showing values of M z < 0 reflected and displayed as positive. The contrast between tissues in an IR pulse sequence is thus strongly dependent on the TI value chosen. Selecting a TI value where a tissue passes through zero effectively \"nulls\" that tissue in the image, rendering it dark. To detect myocardial hyperenhancement (as occurs with infarction and several other diseases) it is desirable to null the signal from nearby normal myocardium. A fixed, predetermined TI value cannot be used, however, as the concentration of gadolinium in both normal myocardium and infarcted tissue decreases over time. To determine the proper inversion time ( TI ) to null normal myocardium, an inversion time mapping sequence is frequently performed as illustrated below. This method is based on a principle developed by Look and Locker used in laboratory NMR spectrometers in the 1970's, When applied to modern MRI it is known as TI scout (Siemens) or Cine IR (GE). The technique consists of a centric ordered, segmented series of cine GRE or b-SSFP echoes obtained over 2-3 heart beats, with each segment corresponding to a different TI value. (Details of available methods are described in another Q&A ). The series of reconstructed images is visually evaluated to select the best TI for optimal myocardial nulling. Inversion Time Mapping Sequence (\" TI Scout\"). Twelve images acquired as part of an inversion time mapping sequence with TI values ranging incrementally from about 200300 ms. Here the best suppression of normal myocardium can be seen in the second row, third image, corresponding to a TI of 260 ms. To save time some centers do not perform TI scouting, but prefer to estimate the optimal TI based on experience and dose of contrast related to body weight. Additionally the use of phase-sensitive IR techniques (discussed in the next Q&A ) show contrast enhancement over a wide range of values and makes imaging less dependent on an exact value for TI .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ti-to-null-myocardium.html"}

In a Q&A long, long ago , we discussed the difference between linear and circularly polarized RF coils in their use in transmission of the B 1 field. In brief, the sinusoidal fluctuation of the transmit RF field B 1 (green arrow) can be decomposed into two components each half as large: a component rotating in the same direction as nuclear precession ( B 1 + ) and a component rotating in the opposite direction ( B 1  ). The B 1 + subfield is responsible for tipping the nuclear magnetization. The B 1  subfield and rotates opposite the spin system, generating only heat via induced electrical currents but having no effect on nuclei. The example below shows a linearly polarized B 1 demonstrating equal and opposite B1+ and B1 components. In the modern era, nearly all transmit RF coils are circularly polarized, meaning (ideally) that B 1+ = B 1 and B 1  = 0 . Decomposition of an oscillating RF field B1 (green) into B1+ (red) and B1 (blue) subcomponents. The term B 1+rms refers to the \"root mean square\" value of B 1+ averaged over a period of 10 seconds. B 1+peak values may also be used. B 1+rms can be thought of as a supplemental metric to SAR for controlling RF power deposition. Most modern scanners report this value along with SAR for each sequence, but scanners produced before 2013 will probably not. B 1+rms is a more precise exposure metric because it depends primarily on the scanner and sequence and less on the patient than SAR. Definition of B 1 + rms as illustrated for a simple sine wave. Because the wave has equal positive and negative portions, the simple average B 1 + avg is meaningless and always equals zero over any complete cycle. By squaring the B 1 + (t) amplitude at each point before summing over time interval T the root mean square produces a positive value. For a sine wave it can be shown by simple calculus that the B 1 + rms = B 1 + peak  2 , or approximately 0.707 x B 1 + peak . The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) describes a method by which manufacturers may calculate B 1+ using the principle that B 1+ scales linearly with voltage supplied to the transmitter. However, because each patient presents a different electronic load to the RF coil, the voltage required to attain a given flip angle must be empirically determined. This calibration occurs during pre-scan, where 1 ms rectangular pulses of different amplitude are tested until the reference transmitter voltage ( V ref ) to achieve a perfect 180-pulse is determined. Once V ref is known, the magnitude of the B 1+ field for any other transmitter voltages can be easily calculated. As shown in a prior Q&A , SAR is directly proportional to ( B 1+) . The advantage of using B 1+rms over SAR is that B 1+rms can be directly calculated by measuring transmitter voltages producing the incident RF irradiation. Because B 1+rms only depends on flip angle, it is independent of B o (main) field strength (unlike SAR that is proportional to B o ). Simulated B1+ tissue distribution through upper abdomen from a circularly polarized body coil at frequencies corresponding to 1.5T, 3.0T, and 7.0T. (modified from Cloos et al under CC-BY) It should be noted that actual B1 and B 1+ vary by location inside the subject and are thus determined as spatially averaged values within an axial center slab. The error in this estimation may be substantial, particularly if an implant is present. In fact, the major use of the B 1+ rms metric is for the conditional labeling of implants. Implant manufacturers are responsible for determining the maximum B 1+ field compatible with safe use of their device in the MRI environment, as illustrated by the Medtronic System manual in the References below.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/b1rms-vs-sar.html"}

When a patient is placed in the bore of a scanner, the magnetic field becomes distorted due to susceptibility effects. These produce small but significant changes in the magnetic field and Larmor frequencies within the patient. For optimal performance the electronic characteristics of the coil should be adjusted to precisely the patient-specific resonance frequency. Because patients vary widely in size and shape, each person changes the impedance (electronic loading) of the transmit/receive coils slightly. For optimal energy transfer between the coil and the patient (in both directions) the impedance of the RF-coil must be matched to the impedance of the transmission line (i.e,, the wires connecting the RF-amplifier and the coil). If impedance matching is not done, a large fraction of the RF power generated by the amplifier will not be transmitted into the patient as it should be, but will be reflected back at the coil-transmission line interface. To insure a good match and efficient RF power transfer, the scanner circuitry monitors the ratio of forward-to-reflected RF power while capacitance is adjusted electronically at the coil-transmission line interface. When an impedance match is obtained, the reflected RF power is minimized. Thirty years ago when I first began my career in MRI, coil tuning and matching was a manual process. The technologist had to walk to the back of the scanner and adjust the coils by turning knobs or flipping switches while watching the reflected RF power indicated by lights (Diasonics) or meter (Picker). On modern scanners the process is entirely automated. Failure to properly tune and match the coil may result in noisy images with poor contrast.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/coil-tuningmatching.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems are approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonias, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. An implanted pulse generator (IPG) is typically placed subcutaneously in the infraclavicular fossa, connected by wires that travel up the neck and enter the skull through small burr holes. Electrodes at the distal end of each wire terminate in the thalamus, internal globus pallidus, or subthalamic nucleus. DBS electrodes on x-ray Hemorrhage and edema at a DBS electrode tip during MRI as reported by Henderson (2005) The primary MR safety concern for DBS systems is heating at the electrode tip due to induced currents and the antenna effect . Antennas capture electromagnetic waves and develop standing-wave patterns of voltage and current that are concentrated near their tips. Three clinical cases have been reported in association with MRI, including one leaving permanent neurologic deficits (see image left) SAR \"hot-spot\" due to antenna effect at the tip of a deep brain stimulator. (From Iacono et al under CC BY) Three companies produce all DBS systems worldwide: Abbott (St. Jude) , Boston Scientific , and Medtronic . All new DBS systems currently sold are MR Conditional (with some very stringent requirements outlined below). Several MR Unsafe legacy devices may still be encountered, including the St. Jude Libra, LibraXP, and Brio models; the Boston Scientific Vercise (Model DB-1110-C), and the Medtronic Reclaim (Model 3391). Some even older models (before 2010) may not be technically rated as MR Unsafe, but may behave unpredictably due to the presence of magnetic reed switches causing IPG malfunction in the magnetic field. What are the Conditions? The precise conditions that must be followed for safe MR Scanning of DBS systems vary somewhat among the models and manufacturers, but share many common features: Device identification . The exact model/serial numbers from the various components of the DBS system, including the IPG, leads, and lead caps or extensions (if present) must be established with certainty. This can be done by reviewing operative notes from the medical record or the patient's information card. For some systems this information can be obtained by wireless interrogation of the IPG. Determine location of components . Verify (by x-ray if necessary) that the IPG has been implanted subcutaneously in the upper chest and that the wires ascend in the neck along the same side as the IPG (Intracranially, the leads may cross the midline). Commonly the leads are longer than anatomically necessary and the surgeon coils the excess leads subcutaneously in the scalp or subcutaneously near the IPG. As a rule, less induction current will be generated by multiple small loops than a single large loop. Special considerations for \"lead only\" systems . MR scanning of DBS systems without an IPG in place is permissible (the so-called \"Lead Only\" Configuration) with some additional imaging parameter restrictions. Proximal bare leads should be capped with \"lead boots\" and no extensions are allowed. A burr hold cover/plate may be required. Pre-MRI evaluation/interrogation of the DBS system . The IPG battery should be fully charged and lead impedances should measure within expected values. The IPG should be turned off or placed in \"MRI Mode\" if available. MRI Equipment and Protocols . These conditions will vary significantly between manufacturers and DBS models. All current MR-conditional DBS devices are restricted to H imaging in horizontal bore cylindrical magnets operating at 1.5 or 3.0T. Only the supine or prone patient positions are allowed. Limits for maximum spatial gradient, gradient slew rate, total imaging time, and RF power dissipation measured by average SAR or maximum B 1+RMS must be followed explicitly. For several models there are restrictions on the use of various transmit coils and power deposition limits depending on the location of magnet isocenter. More limitations will exist when the body coil is used for RF-transmission rather than localized transmit-receive head or knee coils. Before, During, and After MRI .

Three factors are considered in selecting phase- and frequency-encode directions: 1) reducing artifacts, 2) minimizing scanning time, and 3) accommodating restrictions imposed by coil design or parallel imaging. The phase-encoding direction is associated with two major artifacts: wrap-around and flow/motion. Wrap-around (also called aliasing ) occurs when the size of the body part imaged exceeds the defined field-of-view (FOV) in the phase-encode direction. This causes anatomy outside the FOV to be folded in over the main part of the image. Although methods exist to overcome this artifact (phase-oversampling) they require additional phase-encoding measurements to be made and hence incur an imaging time penalty. As a rule, therefore, to avoid wrap-around the phase-encoding direction is usually chosen to be along the shortest anatomic dimension . Wrap-around artifact in PE direction Flow and motion artifacts are also propagated predominantly in the phase-encode direction. Moving anatomic structures often producing problematic artifacts during MR imaging include the eyes, pharynx (swallowing), heart, lungs, diaphragm, and upper abdominal organs. The phase-encoding direction is usually chosen so that these artifacts do not project over the area of interest. For example, axial brain images are usually phase-encoded from left to right so that artifacts from the eyes do not spill over into the brain. Phase-encoding in AP direction Phase-encoding in LR direction Artifacts from pulsatile blood flow behave in a similar fashion and are propagated along the phase-encoding axis. Arterial pulsations from the heart and aorta are particularly problematic, but flow artifacts may occur from any vessel, even large veins. Appropriate choice of phase- and frequency-encoding directions will not eliminate these artifacts but will move them off the area of interest. Susceptibility artifacts due to metal objects often produce image distortions and degradation. Here it may be impossible to predict in advance which direction for phase- or frequency-encoding is optimal. Trial and error may be necessary. I have been pleasantly surprised on numerous occasions that by simply swapping phase- and frequency-encoding directions empirically, very severe susceptibility artifacts may be reduced or moved away from from the area of interest. Minimizing scanning time is also a consideration when selecting phase- and frequency-encode directions. This is especially important for 3D acquisitions where one of the two phase-encoding directions is used for slice-selection. More phase encode steps require more imaging time so it is important to make sure the principle slice-select direction is along the shortest anatomic dimension. In 3D spine imaging, for example, where long rectangular 3D volumes are used, the principal slice-select direction is always chosen to be in the sagittal plane to minimize imaging time. Finally, coil design and parallel imaging considerations may impose limitations on choice of phase-encode direction. For example, in total spine imaging using multiple surface coils arrayed from superiorly to inferiorly, only the anterior-posterior or left-right directions may be used for phase-encoding as a restriction imposed by the parallel imaging technique.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/choosing-pefe-direction.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Stents are widely used throughout the entire arterial system, ranging from vessels several centimeters across (like the thoracic aorta) down to vessels only a few millimeters in diameter (like coronary and intracranial arteries). Simple stents are cylindrical solid or mesh-like tubes made of metal or plastic whose function is to maintain vascular patency in the presence of stenosis or compression. A stent-graft is an expandable metal stent covered with fabric that forms its own lumen and is commonly placed in aneurysms. Nearly all metal stents are made of non-ferric materials such as 300-series stainless steel, Nitinol, Elgiloy, or other alloys. Non-covered stents may be bare (metal only) or impregnated with a medication (so-called drug-eluting stents). \"MR Conditional\" stent graft treating a thoracic aneurysm (Courtesy Cook) To my knowledge, there are no currently implanted stents that are considered MR Unsafe . In the past the Zenith AAA stainless steel stent-graft was placed in this category by its manufacturer ( Cook ), but this restriction has now been lifted. Like other metallic stents it is considered MR Conditional at 1.5T and 3.0T. Although safe to scan as long as conditions are followed, some stents like the Zenith produce a substantial susceptibility artifacts making assessment of stent patency by MRI difficult. Another outdated concept is that one must wait 4-8 weeks before scanning a patient with a newly-implanted metal stent. The idea was that the stent needed time to \"settle in\" and become incorporated in the vessel wall before risking displacement by magnetic forces. As recently as 10 years ago, the package inserts of many stents, especially uncovered coronary stents, carried a warning not to scan patients in the first 6 weeks unless absolutely necessary. Since that time, several papers have been published demonstrating the safety of scanning patients immediately after stent placement; so that is the protocol I follow and recommend. Metallic stents may indeed undergo heating during RF-excitation, but this also does not seem to be a major problem even with overlapping stents or with big aortic stent-grafts, in part because flowing blood serves to diffuse away whatever heat is locally generated. The \"conditions\" associated with some stents recommend that whole-body-averaged SAR levels not exceed 2 W/kg and a maximum of 15 minutes per sequences, while other stents permit up to 4 W/kg. If you don't know the exact model of the stent you are scanning it is therefore safer to use the lower limit.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/vascular-stentsgrafts.html"}

What is it and how does it work? Principle of RF multi-transmit technology. Two or more coil elements are independently powered and controlled, resulting in increased speed and RF homogeneity. (Diagram courtesy of Canon). Use of dual-transmit RF to reduce standing wave (dielectric shading) artifacts. (Courtesy Philips Medical Systems) Multi-transmit or parallel transmission technology is one of the most exciting recent developments in MRI. In many ways it is the natural extension of widely used parallel receiver imaging applied to optimize properties of the transmitted ( B 1 ) field. The basic idea is relatively simple: instead of the entire RF coil transmitting a single B 1 field, divide the coil into separate independently powered and controlled elements that each produce their own B 1 subfields. The sum of these subfields constitutes the net B 1 field experienced by the tissue. In this manner it is possible to more carefully control the homogeneity of RF excitation as well as the distribution of magnetic and electric fields produced in tissue. This has the practical application of reducing standing wave ( dialectric effect ) shading artifacts as well as minimizing RF-energy deposition in tissues. B1 field generated by a dual-transmit RF coil In multi-transmit systems power is distributed to the ports of the RF transmit coil (typically a TEM resonator) using two or more independent channels. The design of such systems requires rigorous control over timing, phase, power and amplitude of each channel, as well as various safety adaptations. All RF-transmitters are synchronized with sub-nanosecond precision and each channel is driven by its own solid state RF-amplifier. Each channel has its own transmit/receive (T/R) switch to allow bimodal operation if desired. Alternatively, the resonator can be operated purely in transmit mode with separate surface coils used as receiver elements. An amplifier shutdown unit is required to avoid potentially hazardous increase in tissue heating should a single channel fail. Circulators are needed to protect amplifiers against reflected or coupled power from coil elements. Prior to imaging a calibration sequence (typically a 3D gradient echo field phase mapping technique) is required to to optimize the power, amplitude, phase and waveforms of the individual RF sources to each patients anatomy. This process is called adaptive RF-shimming . Notwithstanding the time involved in this calibration, total imaging times with 2-channel RF systems may be reduced on certain high specific absorption rate (SAR) sequences by 30% or more by allowing more slices per TR.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/multi-transmit-rf.html"}

Following the \"epidemic\" of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in the late 2000's, most MRI centers developed policies restricting and/or reducing the use of gadolinium contrast in \"at risk\" patients. Protocols were created to identify patients with impaired renal function by medical history and measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The rationale was that nearly all historically documented cases of NSF had occurred in patients with either acute kidney failure or chronic kidney disease with eGFRs < 30 mL/min/1.73 m. This strategy was successful, as between 2010 and 2020 virtually all NSF cases had been eliminated world-wide. By the 2020's radiologists began to reconsider whether these approaches were too conservative. Obtaining an eGFR adds extra time and expense, and restricting use of gadolinium contrast in patients with renal insufficiency might adversely impact patient management. Furthermore, it became widely recognized that overwhelming majority of NSF cases had occurred in patients who had received ACR Group I agents (gadopentetate, gadodiamide, or gadoversetamide). Conversely, only a small handful of cases of NSF had been reported for patients receiving only ACR Group II agents ( gadoterate, gadobenate, gadobutrol, gadoteridol). No NSF cases have been documented in patients receiving the newest agents (ACR Group III: gadoxetate and gadopiclenol). Between 2015 and 2020 multiple papers began to appear in the literature reporting the safety of Group II agents in thousands of patients with renal failure or insufficiency. In 2021 a consensus statement between and American College of Radiology and the National Kidney Foundation explicitly recognized that the risk of NSF was exceedingly low even in patients with kidney disease provided Group II agents in standard dose were administered. Although each MRI Center must adopt protocols suitable to their needs, I would suggest the following basic tenets be followed based on my perception of current best practices in the United States: Use gadolinium contrast only when deemed necessary by the radiologist. Do not use Group I agents. Routine screening and laboratory testing (eGFR) for renal disease are not required provided standard dose Group II agents are used. If a Group III agent is being considered for use, check eGFR. If < 30, consult with clinician.

Three methods are commonly used to measure perfusion using MRI: Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) , Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) , and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) . Both DSC and DCE require intravenous bolus administration of gadolinium, while ASL is performed without exogenous contrast. These techniques will be briefly described below, with more detailed explanations in subsequent Q&A's. Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted image of malignant brain tumor Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) map of cerebral blood volume Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) map of transfer constant ( K trans ) Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) map of cerebral blood flow (CBF) Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) Perfusion MRI DSC perfusion imaging begins with a bolus of gadolinium chelate injected intravenously, followed by a series of rapidly acquired gradient or spin echo images over the organ of interest. As the gadolinium first passes through the regional circulation, it remains largely confined to the intravascular space. Due to its paramagnetic properties, gadolinium creates a local magnetic field distortion around vessels, with T2 (T2*) dephasing and loss of signal as the bolus passes. By measuring signal intensity as a function of time and fitting to a mathematical model, various perfusion parameters (e.g., blood volume, blood flow, mean transit time) can be extracted. Because DSC imaging depends only on the first pass of the contrast agent, it is sometimes known as bolus tracking MRI . Image acquisition time is therefore very short (~2 min). Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) Perfusion MRI Like DSC imaging, DCE also requires exogenous administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. DCE, however, exploits the T1 shortening effects of gadolinium, acquiring repeated T1-weighted images over an approximately 5-10 minute interval. During this time frame, gadolinium contrast accumulates within the tissue extracellular space at a rate determined by perfusion, capillary permeability, and surface area. The image data may be analyzed visually or semiquantitatively. Full quantification may be obtained by applying a compartmental model allowing several physiological parameters to be derived, including the transfer constant ( K trans ), fractional plasma volume ( v p ), and fractional volume of the tissue extracellular space ( v e ). Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) Unlike DSC and DCE perfusion MRI, ASL does not require the administration of gadolinium contrast. Instead, the patient's own water molecules serve as an endogenous diffusible tracer. This is accomplished by \"magnetically labeling\" water molecules in proximal blood vessels with radiofrequency pulses. As these molecules flow into the organ of interest they reduce tissue signal intensity in proportion to perfusion. In the typical ASL pulse sequence, images are acquired both with and without labeling pulses, then subtracted. By applying a mathematical model, various perfusion parameters (principally blood flow) can be obtained. The signal-to-noise of ASL techniques is inherently low, and so multiple signal averages must be acquired resulting in 3-5 minute minimum imaging times to obtain useful data. Because it is signal-to-noise limited, ASL performs significantly better at 3T than 1.5T. More detailed descriptions of DSC, DCE, and ASL are provided in subsequent Q&A's.

Task-based BOLD/fMRI studies can be divided into three basic types: 1) block, 2) event-related, and 3) mixed. Block Designs Block designs are the oldest functional imaging paradigms, widely used for PET studies prior the invention of fMRI. Task periods (also known as epochs ) are alternated with periods of rest. Lower BOLD signal during rest periods are digitally \"subtracted\" from higher BOLD signal during task states to reveal focal areas of cortical activation. Three designs of BOLD/fMRI experiments Finger tapping fMRI study using simple block design comparing signals during activity and at rest. Because the \"on-off\" pattern of activation resembles the passing of a train, the paradigm is often referred to as a \"boxcar\" design. Block designs are the simplest and most straightforward paradigms to implement. They are most widely used for clinical fMRI studies whose purpose is to identify eloquent cortical areas prior to surgery. In the classic \"finger tapping\" experiment shown left and described in a separate Q&A , the patient taps her fingers for 15 seconds followed by an equal length period of rest. After correcting for noise and spatial distortions, areas whose net BOLD signals exceed certain statistical thresholds are said to be \"activated\". Compared to other fMRI paradigms, block designs possess the highest signal-to-noise, statistical power, and maximal time efficiency. In addition to the simple \"on-off\" block design described above, more complex block designs are possible. For example, two or more activities can be alternated with each other and with periods of rest. Notwithstanding these advantages, block designs have limited utility especially within the setting of more complex neuropsychological experiments involving non-binary tasks. Even with simple tasks, subjects can anticipate the order or duration of the simple blocks, introducing confounding variables. Finally, because blocks are measured over relatively long periods (10-20 sec), information about the hemodynamic response and fMRI signal timing are difficult to measure. Event-related Designs Event-related designs allow for single or multiple tasks and stimuli to take place at short and variable time intervals. These paradigms provide the high degree of flexibility required for sophisticated neuropsychological experiments. Events can be randomized and different types of events can be mixed. The subject cannot predict when or what will occur, allowing for surprises. Event-related designs allow for better temporal resolution and estimation of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) time course. It is possible to assess the \"learning curve\" and practice effects during an experiment, as well as the effect of the interstimulus interval. Disadvantages of event-related designs include lower signal-to-noise and statistical power, with longer imaging times and more trials per subject required. Analysis of the data is significantly more complex and dependent on accurate modeling of the HRF. At the same time, post hoc analysis allows events to be resorted and reclassified after the study. For example, correct and incorrect responses can be separated and independently analyzed. Mixed Designs Mixed paradigms embody features of blocked and event-related designs. Here, semirandomized events take place during the task blocks, with rest periods in between. Mixed paradigms thus tend to preserve the favorable signal-to-noise characteristics of blocked methods with the flexibility of even-related ones.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fmri-paradigm-design.html"}

Several videos on the internet show small biological objects apparently defying gravity by floating in the bores of research magnets. An example is shown below. The fields used are very large (on the order of 15T) and the objects are very small (tadpoles, insects, blades of grass). This is a highly visual and memorable demonstration of diamagnetism . Most biological materials (including human bodies) contain high concentrations of water and are weakly diamagnetic. When placed in an external magnetic field an internal polarization develops that opposes the applied field and a counterbalancing diamagnetic force is generated. If the object is light and the magnetic field is strong, this diamagnetic force is sufficient to eliminate the effects of gravity, allowing the object to \"float\".

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Radiofrequency irradiation used in MRI causes tissue heating, primarily the result of ohmic (resistive) losses due to induced electrical currents. The rate of RF energy deposition (power) absorbed per mass of tissue is called the specific absorption rate (SAR) , typically reported in units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). Various regulatory organizations, like the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have established safe limits for SAR deposition and temperature changes in patients undergoing MRI. Patients at risk for thermoregulatory disturbances include infants, pregnant women, the elderly, obese, diabetics, febrile patients, anesthetized patients, and those with cardiac decompensation. Core body temperature (normal 36C  38 C) is regulated by the hypothalamus, but can disturbed by certain medications  beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, amphetamines, anesthetic agents, and sedatives. For such patients, as well as any unable to effectively communicate, monitoring body temperature during MRI is required. A wide range of potential sites are available for temperature measurement: skin, mouth, axilla, groin esophagus, rectum, pulmonary artery, and bladder. Superficial sites (skin, axilla, groin) are most commonly used due to their accessibility, but are affected by perspiration, ambient air circulation, humidity, use of blankets, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Deep sites (esophagus, bladder, rectum) more accurately reflect core body temperature but are more cumbersome to use and set up. The simplest (and cheapest) skin thermometers are non-magnetic with a liquid crystal displays. They can be stuck on the forehead or other easily visible site and may be suitable for relatively brief MR exams to provide a modicum of reassurance concerning body temperature in otherwise non-critical patients. Thermistor and thermocouple-based sensors are subject to drift and may cause RF interference, so should be avoided in the MR environment.

Experienced radiologists generally become familiar with the expected appearances of normal blood vessels on their own scanners when consistent imaging parameters are used; and at times they may even be capable of diagnosing subtle disorders of flow by using pattern recognition. However, no radiologist, even a world \"expert\", can consistently predict (or even fully explain) the complex signals observed within any vessel, given an arbitrary set of imaging parameters. The reason for this uncertainty is that the appearance of flowing blood on MR images depends in a complex and nonintuitive fashion both on the details of the pulse sequence employed and the physical characteristics of flow. Technical factors affecting the appearance of flowing blood include the type of pulse sequence (spin echo, gradient echo, inversion recovery), repetition time ( TR ), echo time ( TE ), and flip angle (  ). The use of flow compensation (gradient-moment nulling), saturation pulses, and cardiac gating also has profound effects. Additionally, even small changes in slice thickness, interslice gap, number of slices, or slice excitation order may have radical effects on the appearance of normal blood vessels at MR imaging. Marked variations in the appearance of flow may also exist between different brands of scanners run with otherwise identical user-specified parameters. Physical characteristics of flow are also important determinants of a vessel's appearance on MR images. These characteristics include not only flow direction and average velocity, but also acceleration, pulsatility, and the distribution of velocities across the vessel. The internal \"structure\" of the flow is important, as differences are noted between laminar, vortex, and turbulent patterns. No wonder even sophisticated computer programs are not yet fully able to predict the wide spectrum of normal vascular appearances encountered on MR images! Notwithstanding these uncertainties, several general principles can be derived concerning the appearance of flow on MR images: Rapid or turbulently flowing fluids generally have low signal on conventional spin-echo images, resulting in a so-called flow void . Conversely, slowly flowing blood or CSF generally appears bright on conventional spin-echo images, a phenomenon sometimes called paradoxical enhancement . Fresh blood flowing into a volume of tissue results in high intravascular signal at the end slices of a multisection acquisition; this is a time-of-flight effect called flow-related enhancement or simply the entry phenomenon . Saturation pulses applied outside the field of view will reduce or eliminate the entry phenomenon, making these vessels dark. The use of gradient-moment nulling (flow compensation) gradients will result in increased signal within veins and smaller arteries, but faster flow in larger arteries will still demonstrate flow voids. Cardiac gating may restore signal not only to small vessels, but to larger ones as well. Two different flow-related signal changes may be observed when trains of evenly spaced (i.e., TE=30/60/90/120) spin echoes are employed. Loss of signal occurs after odd-numbered (i.e., 30, 90) echoes ( odd-echo dephasing ) whereas increased signal will be seen on even-numbered (60, 120) echoes ( even-echo rephasing ). Gadolinium contrast shortens the T1 of blood and generally increases the signal from all vessels, but especially veins.

Saturation pulses involve the application of RF energy to suppress the MR signal from moving tissues outside the imaged volume to reduce or eliminate motion artifacts. Three types of saturation pulses exist: Spatial Saturation Pulses are based around a spatially selective 90-pulse that flips magnetization into the transverse plane. Unlike the 90-excitation pulses used for imaging, these spatial saturation pulses are transmitted at a different carrier frequency and are designed to produce maximal phase dispersion across the saturation band. No slice rephasing lobe is used. In fact, the spatial saturation pulse is followed by strong spoiler gradients placed along the FE and PE axes to further suppress residual transverse magnetization. Spatial saturation pulses are known as \" Presat pulses \" by Siemens, Hitachi, and Canon; \" Sat pulses \" by GE, and the \" REgional Saturation Technique ( REST )' by Philips. Spatial saturation bands are graphically prescribed on scout images by the technologist prior to scanning. Their angulation, center, and width may be adjusted, with typical thicknesses in the 5-10 cm range. Spatial saturation band placed on anterior neck to reduce swallowing artifacts over spine Flow saturation pulses are spatially selective saturation bands applied to suppress unwanted flow artifacts from vessels entering a slice. The saturation band is applied parallel to the imaged slice a location a few centimeters upstream (optimal position depends on flow velocity). Although mostly used to suppress arterial flow for routine imaging, in time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography vascular saturation slabs are used to suppress venous flow. Arterial saturation pulse to suppress flow artifacts in an imaged slice. To suppress venous flow a band on the opposite side of the slice should be chosen. For TOF MRA the venous saturation pulse follows along at a constant offset next to each imaged slice in the multi-slice acquisition. These moving vascular saturation pulses have different names according to vendor: GE (\" walking sat \"), Siemens (\" travel sat \" or \" tracking sat \"), Philips (\" travel REST ), Hitachi (\" sequential pre-sat \"), and Canon (\" BFAST \"). T1-weighted abdomen image without flow saturation shows marked artifact from aorta. Application of superior flow saturation pulse decreases signal in aorta and eliminates vascular flow artifact. Spectral Saturation Pulses suppress a particular chemical species, usually fat, based on its chemical shift. Also known as Fat-Sat or Chemical Shift Selective (CHESS) , these are short-duration RF-pulses tuned to the resonance frequency of fat and applied immediately before the start of an MR imaging sequence. Chemically selective pulses cause the signal from fat to be nulled (saturated) while the water signal is relatively unaffected.

Because millions of such IUDs were implanted, a reasonable possibility exists that a middle-aged or older Chinese woman might still have one in place. If reliable medical history is unavailable, these devices should be easily identifiable on x-ray by their opacity and circular shape. Barrier Devices Barrier contraceptive devices include sponges, female condoms, and diaphragms. Composed primarily of latex and other plastics, these devices may all be scanned without concern. Many diaphragms contain a flexible metal ring, but to my knowledge no movement, pain, heating or unexpected pregnancies have resulted from their use in the MR environment. Tubal Ligation/Occlusion Devices Tubal rings (Falope, Yoon, Lay) are small silastic bands placed around a loop of the fallopian tube. They are MR Safe. Tubal clips are clamped externally across the fallopian tube to close its lumen. The popular Filshie  clips are made of titanium, while the Hulka  /Wolf  clips are plastic with a stainless steel spring. Both are MR Conditional up to 3.0T. Essure devices are metal/fiber coils previously used to internally occlude the fallopian tubes. Although removed from the market in 2018, these are \"lifetime\" devices for patients having received them. They are MR Conditional at 3.0T and below. The AltaSeal  ( AltaScience ), like the Essure, is a permanent fallopian tube occlusion device placed by hysteroscopy. Used in Europe (but not yet FDA-approved for the US), the AltaSeal is a 300-series stainless steel micro-insert similar to a coronary stent.

Over the last decade T2-FLAIR has largely replaced proton-density sequences for neuroimaging, but they are still used in musculoskeletal and other body applications. Dual-echo FSE with TR = 3000.

Zero and low-amplitude phase encoding steps are performed both early and late along the FSE echo train. This produces two sets of low spatial frequency images with short and long effective TE's (typically TE1 eff at <20 ms and TE2 eff at >80 ms) reflecting the dominant image contrast of spin-density and T2-weighting.

Classic model is centered on Wernicke's (receptive) and Broca's (expressive) areas. \"Dual stream\" model incorporates these areas into a ventral stream (red) serving comprehension and a dorsal stream (blue) for articulation.  The \"classic\" model for language processing focuses on two specialized brain regions in the left hemisphere: 1) Wernicke's area (green) along the posterior superior temporal gyrus, involved in the reception and comprehension of language, and 2) Broca's area (blue) along the posterior inferior frontal gyrus, involved in expression/articulation of speech. Conduction of information from Wernicke's to Broca's areas takes place along subcortical white matter pathways, primarily the arcuate fasciculus . Over the last decade a more complex \"dual stream\" model has been embraced by much of the neuroscience community, recognizing the role of additional involvement of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes in language processing. In this model a bilaterally organized ventral stream processes speech signals for comprehension and a strongly left-dominant dorsal stream maps acoustic speech to articulatory networks in the frontal lobe.  Language-related fMRI for pre-surgical planning has two primary goals: localization of eloquent cortex (Wernicke's and Broca's areas) and determination of hemispheric language dominance. No standard paradigms exist across all practices, but the most commonly used are available at the ASFNR web site referenced below. A minimum of one semantic and one phonological paradigm should be employed, and the best centers typically employ 2-3 of each. Regardless of the protocol selected, an important principle is to occupy the patient with non-language activities during control periods (e.g., showing them scrambled letters or meaningless symbols). This is required because many patients will default to language functions during rest, introducing confounding variables. Phonologic Paradigms Phonological paradigms are used to elicit activation of Broca's area and other parts of the dorsal stream involved in the production of sounds and articulation of language. One of the most commonly used of these is silent word generation . The subject is shown a letter (e.g., \"B\") and over the next 5-10 seconds is asked to silently think of as many words as possible starting with that letter (\"baby\", \"bed\", etc.) During the control/rest periods the subject is shown nonsense symbols (e.g., \"  \", \"\"). (A) (B) (C) Silent word generation task producing activation of left prefrontal cortex (A); bilateral Broca's areas, left greater than right (B); and right cerebellum (C) Other (mostly) phonological paradigms include rhyming (\"Think of as many words that rhyme with the displayed word\" or \"Push the button if the pair of displayed words rhyme\"), naming (\"What is the object in this picture?\", and antonyms (\"What is the opposite of hot?\"). It should be noted that no paradigm is \"pure\" in that both dorsal and ventral streams are commonly activated to some degree in most patients. Semantic Paradigms Semantic paradigms are primarily designed to elicit activation of Wernicke's area as well as other portions of the ventral stream involved in decoding language and establishing meaning. As with phonologic paradigms, some activation of Broca's area invariably occurs. The input may be auditory or visual. Typical semantic tasks used in fMRI studies include sentence completion (\"I drive to work in my ____\"), true/false statements (\"Is the displayed statement true or false?\"), reading comprehension (whole paragraphs with questions), and listening comprehension (spoken language with questions vs garbled speech).

Non-AI Methods Techniques for producing high-resolution images from lower-resolution ones were developed over 40 years ago for photography and video recording. By the end of the 1990's, one of these methods, known as zero interpolation filling (the subject of its own Q&A ) was offered as product by major MR vendors that proved especially useful for MR angiography. The underlying idea was adding zeros at the edges of the k-space matrix before inverse Fourier Transformation could improve the apparent spatial resolution of the image due to reduced partial volume artifacts. Zero filling thus acts as a method to interpolate the signals from neighboring voxels, giving the image a smoother and less \"pixel-ly\" appearance. Other interpolation methods on such as cubic splines are commonly used. Super-resolution using zero-interpolation filling (ZIP) of an MRA with resolution increased from 128x128 to 256x256, For moving subjects additional super-resolution methods are available, some of which have been derived from video recording. Voxel shift methods have proved particularly well suited for this task. In cardiac imaging, for example, nearly the same images of the heart are available in successive cine images, allowing sharing and interpolation of data among nearby views. Deep Learning Methods In more recent times, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to generate super-resolution images.

Can you explain some of the pacemaker types and terminology relevant to us working in MRI? Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (CIEDs) are designed to detect and treat disturbances in cardiac rhythm ( arrhythmias ). CIEDs include both Permanent Pacemakers (PPMs) and Implanted Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICDs) . PPMs deliver relatively mild shocks to the cardiac conduction system and are used primarily for treatment of slow heart rates ( bradycardias ). ICDs deliver high energy shocks for treatment of rapid heart rates ( tachycardias ). Standard CIED Configurations With the exception of a few uncommon \"leadless\" and epicardial devices described below, virtually all CIEDs contain the following elements: A pulse generator (PG) , including a lithium-ion battery and electronics housed in a titanium \"can\", surgically implanted in the chest wall below the clavicle. 1-3 insulated wires leads passed fluoroscopically from the PG to the right heart via the subclavian vein and superior vena cava. Terminal electrodes are affixed to the myocardium by spiral wires or tines. Most modern terminal electrodes are bipolar, meaning they have two bare contact points near their tips, allowing focused sensing of the heart's local electrical activity and accurate delivery of pacing shocks as needed. Single lead CIEDs typically terminate in the right atrial appendage or right ventricle. They are uncommon and primarily used for bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction. The overwhelming majority of CIEDs contain two leads (one in the right atrium and one in the right ventricle) for dual-chamber sensing and pacing that follows the natural contraction sequence of the heart. Three-lead CIEDs are primarily used in patients with heart failure or left bundle branch block who require biventricular pacing. The third wire passes through the coronary sinus and into a coronary vein to simulate the left ventricle transvenously. This configuration is commonly referred to as Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) . Rarely additional leads are present for bundle of His or multisite pacing. Typical locations for 1-, 2-, and 3-lead pacemakers. Chest x-ray showing a biventricular PPM with 3 leads Strong depolarization currents (red arrows) flow between shock coils (yellow arrows) in superior vena cava and right ventricle CIEDs that operate as high-energy ICDs demonstrate several differences compared to simple PMs. Their PGs are slightly larger, containing bigger batteries and capacitors for storing charge. They have large surface area electrodes known as shock coils located coaxially along the surface of the pace/sense leads. These shock coils are typically located in the right ventricle and also often in the superior vena cava. They can be recognized on x-ray as focal areas of wire thickening. Strong currents pass between the shock coils to depolarize the heart. Sometimes the housing of the PG functions as an additional current source, the so-called \" active can \" configuration. Several terms are frequently encountered when discussing pacemaker function with regard to MRI: Asynchronous (fixed) pacing : A mode of operation where the PM delivers stimuli at a constant rate regardless of intrinsic cardiac signals. Synchronous (demand) pacing : A mode of operation where the PM delivers a stimulus after a certain time period if no expected cardiac signal is sensed. Pacing capture threshold : The minimum electrical stimulus measured in millivolts (mV) to consistently depolarize (\"capture\") the myocardium. This can increase over time as fibrosis builds at the electrode tip. Lead impedance : A measure of resistance to electrical flow within a lead measured in ohms ( ) . A break in the lead can dramatically increase impedance, while a defect in the insulation can result in a short with low impedance. Reed switch: an electrical component within older pulse generators that controls pacing mode and may open/close unpredictably in MRI. NBG Codes for Pacemakers The N orth American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology and B ritish Pacing and Electrophysiology G roups ( NBG ) have jointly developed a coding system to describe various pacing modes. The full (revised) code contains 5 letters, but often only the first three are used. The first letter indicates the chamber(s) paced: A=atrium, V=ventricle, or D=dual (both A&V) The second letter indicates in which chamber(s) electrical activity is sensed: A, V, or D. The letter O indicates no sensing is used. The third letter refers to how the PM responds to a sensed cardiac electric signal: T=triggered to give a shock, I= inhibited, D=dual response (any spontaneous A and V activity will inhibit both A&V pacing, but lone atrial activity will trigger a paced ventricular response), and O= no sensing. The fourth and fifth letters are used to denote rate modulation and multisite pacing and are only occasionally used. Common operational modes include DDD (Atrial and ventricular sequential pacing, with pacing impulses triggered only when programmed intervals are exceeded), VVI (pure ventricular pacing whenever R wave is not detected), DOO (dual asynchronous pacing at constant rate regardless of intrinsic cardiac activity, and OOO (pacemaker disabled). NBD Codes for Defibrillators A shortened code by the same societies has been promulgated to reflect the common modes of ICD operation: ICD-S : An ICD with shock capability only ICD-B : An ICD with bradycardia pacing as well as shock ICD-T : An ICD with both tachycardia (and bradycardia) pacing as well as shock Other Pacing Methods and Devices Temporary Transvenous Pacing is used primarily in emergency situations like acute profound bradycardia. A pacemaker wire is passed through the femoral or internal jugular vein into the heart, while the pulse generator remains outside the body. Due to the risk of significant lead heating demonstrated in animal models, these devices are considered MR Unsafe . Temporary Epicardial Pacing leads are placed in contact with the outer wall of the right heart at the end of open-heart surgery. The wires then extend percutaneously through the chest wall where they are hooked to a small battery-powered pulse generator. The wires are usually removed within a few days to weeks after the patient's postoperative rhythm disturbances have subsided. Permanent Epicardial Pacemakers are used occasionally in pediatric patients with complex congenital heart disease. The pulse generator is typically placed subcutaneously in the upper abdominal wall. \"MR Unsafe\" temporary transvenous pacemaker inserted via right internal jugular approach Temporary epicardial pacing wires Case courtesy of Dr Jeremy Jones, Radiopaedia.org .

MR Elastography (MRE) allows estimation of the mechanical properties of tissue in response to compression or vibration. Available as a commercial product from at least three MR vendors, its current principal application is for staging hepatic fibrosis. MRE also shows promise for characterizing lesions of the brain, breast, and heart. A typical liver MRE exam begins by positioning a plastic diaphragm (\"passive driver\") over the liver held in place by an elastic band. This is connected by a long hose to a pneumatic pump (\"active driver\") outside the MRI room that inflates and deflates the diaphragm about 60 times per second. These mechanical impulses induce \"seismic\" shear waves in the liver that can be detected with phase-sensitive MR sequences. Image acquisition is very fast, a single 2D slice obtained within a 20-25 sec breath hold. The Resoundant system for MRE developed by Ehman and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic (Figure adapted from promotional news/marketing materials distributed by resoundant.com) MRE wave and elastogram images compared in a normal subject (upper row) and a patient with hepatic fibrosis (lower row). Figure adapted from Li et al (2015) under CC BY. As tissues become stiffer, waves propagate more rapidly and have longer wavelengths. This can be appreciated by observing the spacing between peak displacements in MRE wave images as shown in the figure. Note the wider wave spacing in the fibrotic liver (lower left) compared to normal liver (upper left). MRE also allows estimation of tissue shear stiffness , typically reported in kiloPascals (kPa) . The kPa is an SI unit for pressure and equals 1000 newtons per square meter. Shear stiffness calculations are displayed as color overlays on anatomic images known as an elastogram . The pulse sequence used for liver MRE is typically a 2D GRE with short TR , short TE , and low flip angle. Bipolar motion-sensitizing gradients are applied similar to those used for phase-contrast MR angiography. As described in a prior Q&A , moving tissues accumulate a phase-shift when bipolar gradients are applied, but stationary tissues do not.

In the prior Q&A we showed how the field-of- view ( FOV ) is inversely related to the spacing ( k ) of samples in k -space. For simplicity of explanation we considered square pixels with the same FOV in each direction. However, by altering the sampling rates along the frequency and phase axes it is possible to alter the FOV along each image dimension independently. FOV f = 1 / k f FOV p = 1 / k p Rectangular (1:2) FOV obtained by sampling every other line in the k p -direction For 2D-spin warp imaging, a rectangular FOV with a 1:2 ratio is obtained by sampling alternate phase-encode lines in k -space while leaving the maximum and minimum amplitudes of the phase-encoding gradient unchanged. This process halves the number of phase-encoding steps ( N p ), but doubles the increment between successive steps. The sampling rate and hence the field-of-view in the frequency-encode direction ( FOV f ) remains unaffected. Furthermore, because both the FOV p and N p have been reduced by one-half, pixel size in the phase-encode direction ( FOV p / N p ) and overall spatial resolution of the image are also unchanged. All MR manufacturers offer rectangular FOV as a standard option applicable to most pulse sequences. The names differ slightly by vendor: \"Rectangular FOV\" (Philips, Hitachi, Canon), \"Phase FOV\" (Siemens), and \"Partial FOV\" (GE). The rectangular FOV option is most beneficial in imaging the spine and extremities, where one anatomical dimension is much longer than the other. Most scanners allow adjusting the phase-sampling ratio over a large range; accordingly, considerable latitude may be permitted in the size and shape of the rectangular FOV. Rectangular FOV techniques have two major drawbacks, however. First, because fewer phase-encoding steps are acquired, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is proportionately lower compared to full FOV imaging. Secondly, wrap-around ( aliasing ) in the phase-encoding direction may occur if the object dimensions exceed this defined FOV p . Careful positioning of the patient and the use of saturation bands may be needed to eliminate this artifact.

Infarcts have shorter T1-values than normal myocardium and recover more quickly due to excessive gadolinium accumulation. Enhancement may be detected by either magnitude or phase-corrected reconstruction by selecting an inversion time ( TI ) near the null point of normal myocardium. Inversion recovery (IR) sequences typically employ magnitude reconstruction to translate the MR signal into pixel intensity. In this method pixel brightness depends only on the magnitude of a tissue's longitudinal magnetization, not its polarity. In other words, two tissues whose magnetization at time TI point in equal but opposite directions along the z -axis will be rendered the same shade of gray and thus be indistinguishable. Magnitude reconstruction is straightforward to implement and allows selective nulling of normal myocardium by selecting an inversion time ( TI ) matching its zero-crossing point. This value can be estimated using the \" TI scouting\" method as described in the prior Q&A . If the wrong TI is picked, however, image contrast between the infarct and viable myocardium may be impaired. This sensitivity to the choice of TI may be overcome by reconstructing the data using a phase-sensitive technique. Phase-sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR) reconstruction preserves the positive and negative polarities of tissues as they recover from the initial 180-inversion pulse. In PSIR tissues with more negative longitudinal magnetizations always appear darker than those with more positive magnetizations. Hence contrast-enhancing (infarcted) tissue always has a higher signal than viable myocardium, regardless of the chosen TI . Unlike magnitude reconstruction the PSIR technique gives good results over a relatively broad range of TI's . Although PSIR reconstruction makes it possible to produce excellent quality contrast-enhanced images without using an inversion-time mapping sequence, the PSIR images will be even better if an optimal estimate by TI -scouting is first made. If TI is not perfectly chosen, detection of contrast enhancement may be impaired using magnitude reconstruction. Phase-sensitive IR is less sensitive to choice of TI as illustrated in this example of of septal ischemia (arrow).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ps-phase-sensitive-ir.html"}

For at least the first two decades of MRI, time-of-flight (TOF) MRA was the dominant non-contrast bright-blood method for imaging the human vascular system. Although now supplanted in body MR imaging by other techniques, it still remains one of the most important methods for noncontrast neurovascular and peripheral MRA. As the name implies TOF MRA is based the principle of flow-related enhancement , a time-of-flight flow phenomenon discussed in a prior Q&A . Stationary tissues in an imaged volume become magnetically saturated by multiple repetitive RF-pulses that drive down their steady-state magnetization levels. \"Fresh\" blood flowing into the imaged volume has not experienced these pulses and thus has a high initial magnetization. The signal from inflowing blood thus appears paradoxically bright compared to background tissue. A maximum intensity projection (MIP) rendering technique with leveling, filtering, and optional surface display is then used to create the MR angiogram. Cranial time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiogram performed at 3T using maximum intensity (MIP) and shaded surface display (SSD). TOF MRA is based on flow-related enhancement, which occurs when fully magnetized blood flows into a slab of magnetically saturated tissue whose signal has been suppressed by repetitive RF-pulses. The TOF angiography method is based around a conventional 2D or 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence with optional gradient-moment nulling. A presaturation pulse is often applied above or below each slice to reduce signal from traversing veins. Moderate-to-large flip angles (3060) are used to maximize contrast between stationary tissue and blood. Short TE values (< 7 msec) are preferred to minimize signal losses from phase dispersion. Maximal enhancement of flow occurs when the vessel is perpendicular to the plane of imaging. TOF techniques are thus somewhat insensitive to in-plane flow. Also, because of saturation effects, maximum slab thickness in 3D TOF MRA may be limited. Various modifications of the TOF technique have been developed to reduce in-plane saturation effects and improve visualization of smaller vessels. These include the use of magnetization transfer saturation pulses, overlapping of multiple slabs (MOTSA), fat suppression, and variable (ramped) flip angles. These methods are described in separate Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/time-of-flight-tof-mra.html"}

An example is shown right. Here note the sharp black etched appearance of the brain where it interfaces with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This is commonly known as the bounce-point artifact (originally named the \"opposed magnetization artifact.\") In IR imaging, tissue magnetization ( M ) is flipped opposite to the main magnetic field and then recovers, passing through zero in the process. As tissues have different T1 values, their recovery curves will be different. In the diagram right, CSF has a longer T1 and recovers more slowly than brain. In magnitude-reconstructed IR only the absolute distance from zero of each tissue's recovery curve determines the displayed signal intensity.

Let us also assume that the inversion time ( TI ) has been to a value between the bounce points for brain and CSF where the curve for brain is exactly the same distance above the zero line as the curve for CSF is below the line. At this point the signals for brain and CSF will be of identical magnitude but 180  out of phase. Their signals will exactly cancel, rendering the boundary pixel black. Even though the bounce point artifact has been described for conventional magnitude corrected IR images, the same phenomenon can be seen with any pulse sequence where an inversion pulse is used. Thus bounce point artifacts may also be seen on such sequences as MP-RAGE, FGATIR, or IR-prepped SPGR.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ir-bounce-point.html"}

Throughout the world, the majority of currently practicing MR technologists began in other branches of diagnostic imaging (principally radiology or nuclear medicine) and have learned their specialty through on-the-job training. In the United States and Canada, most younger MR technologists have received formal classroom and practical training through programs sponsored by junior colleges, technical schools, and hospital systems. The length of such MR specialty programs is typically 6 -12 months following completion of basic certification in general radiology or nuclear medicine. The Joint Review Committee on Education in Radiologic Technology (JRCERT) and the Canadian Medical Association Committee on Conjoint Accreditation (CMA-CCA) evaluate and certify such programs in North America. Most accredited hospitals and health care imaging providers in the US and Canada prefer that employees be registered through the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT), Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (CAMRT), or American Registry of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technologists (ARMRIT).

In addition to the obviously brighter signal from fat seen in FSE/TSE imaging, several other subtle differences in contrast may be noted compared with conventional SE imaging. FSE differences include: 1) decreased sensitivity to susceptibility; 2) increased magnetization transfer effects; and 3) edge and contrast effects. Decreased Sensitivity to Susceptibility An illustrative example of this phenomenon is seen on routine T2-weighted brain images (right). At field strengths of 1.0T and higher, low signal is commonly noted in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and red nuclei secondary to accumulation of intracellular iron in these structures. Microscopic iron deposits cause local distortions of the magnetic field, known as magnetic susceptibility gradients . When water molecules diffuse through these gradients, accelerated spin dephasing and T2*- shortening occurs, reducing the MR signal. The degree of signal loss depends on the time diffusing water spends in the inhomogeneous fields before refocusing by 180-pulses. In CSE, the time for refocusing is determined by echo time (TE), which may be 50 ms or longer. In FSE, however, 180-refocusing pulses occur at very short intervals, determined by ESP (typically 5-10 ms), allowing much less time for susceptibility-induced dephasing. Conventional spin-echo image (top) and fast spin-echo image (bottom), both with TR/TE (eff) = 3000/80. Susceptibility effects due to iron in the red nucleus (arrow) are more prominent on the CSE image. Decreasing conspicuity of dark hemorrhagic foci on FSE image (right) compared to CSE image (left). (From Reimer et al, with permission). Diminished sensitivity to susceptibility makes FSE the sequence of choice whenever surgical hardware or metallic foreign bodies are present, significantly reducing artifacts. This advantage may turn into a disadvantage, however, whenever detection of susceptibility changes within tissue are needed for diagnosis, such as for detection of calcification or hemorrhage. Increased Magnetization Transfer Effects As described in a prior Q&A , magnetization transfer is a process by which spins in a pool of \"free\" water exchange energy with those in a pool of macromolecules and \"bound\" water. The multiple 180-refocusing pulses in FSE provide off-resonance saturation to the macromolecular pool, causing it to become progressively saturated. In brain tissue, the macromolecular pool consists of myelin and membrane phospholipids with very short T2's that are not directly imaged. With increasing number of pulses, the magnetization transfer effect becomes more pronounced, with white matter especially becoming noticeably darker. There is a minor signal loss from gray matter as well. Conversely, the signals from cerebrospinal fluid and fat are not suppressed and these substances appear somewhat brighter than brain. Magnetization transfer effects reflected by progressive decrease in white matter signal as ETL is increased. Edge and Contrast Effects ( k -space Filtering) As illustrated in the examples above, FSE and CSE are similar but structurally different pulse sequences. Even with TR fixed and TE=TE eff , the relative signal intensities of various tissues will not be the same. We have already described several physical phenomena (disruption of J -coupling, decreased sensitivity to susceptibility, and magnetization transfer) that explain some of the differences. An additional important phenomenon (applicable to FSE and all rapid/echo-planar techniques) is called k-space filtering . The fundamental idea is that T2 decay is occurring during each TR interval while the lines of k -space are being filled. Each echo is thus collected at a different point along the T2-decay curve. The lines of k -space are thus weighted unevenly and image contrast is constantly changing throughout the acquisition. k -space filtering. Each line of k -space is collected at a different point on the T2-decay curve, meaning image contrast is continually changing throughout the acquisition. Overall image contrast is determined by data acquired near the center of k -space (at TE eff ), while early and later echoes reflect high spatial frequency information from the periphery of k -space. These peripheral lines, obtained at different TE values, have signal intensities modulated by T2 decay, resulting in blurring of the image. The more echoes collected (i.e., the longer the ETL), the greater will be the blurring. The most spatial blurring occurs when TE eff is short, because the higher order phase encode steps that provide edge detail are being filled with echoes late in the train. Thus T1- and proton-density-weighted images demonstrate the highest degree of blurring. A well-cited clinical example concerns the diagnosis of subtle knee meniscal tears which may be blurred out on proton-density-weighted FSE images. Fluids (like CSF) have long T2 relaxation times, and so there is relatively little change in signal intensity between early and late echoes. Hence for T2-weighted FSE imaging of long T2 materials k -space blurring is not much of a problem. For most solid tissues, however, T2 is shorter there is a significant difference in signal intensity between early and late echoes. Hence more spatial blurring is expected on T2-weighted FSE images of solid, short-T2 tissues. Such blurring may potentially result in failure to detect small objects or lesions with T2 values close to background. When long and short T2 tissues are juxtaposed, an interesting paradoxical phenomenon called pseudo-edge enhancement may occur. Pseudo-edge enhancement is most commonly seen on axial T2-weighted FSE images of the lumbar spine as white \"halos\" surrounding nerve roots. The mechanism is illustrated below and results from blurring (alteration of the image point-spread function) for the nerve root and CSF components. CSF, with long intrinsic T2, does not show much blurring, but nerve roots (with short T2's) do. The blurred signals from the nerve roots spill over into the adjacent high signal CSF, increasing brightness in the vicinity. Even when a halo is not seen, pseudo-edge enhancement explains why nerve roots in the thecal sac are so sharply delineated of FSE images. White halos (arrow) around lumbar nerve roots are due to pseudo-edge enhancement.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/other-fse-differences.html"}

Which protons are producing the MR signal? At this point it is worth summarizing the principal sources of the signal in H MR imaging and spectroscopy. The relative contributions of each source depend on the tissue studied and the particular pulse sequence utilized. The major protons responsible for the MR signal or its modulation: free water, bound water, macromolecules, and fats. Lipid stores are usually in isolated compartments hence the dotted line. Small organic molecules make a very minor contribution to overall signal (except in water suppressed MRS) and are not pictured. Water . H 2 O protons are the largest and most important source of the NMR signal in biological tissues. In a human cell, there are about as many water protons as there are all H protons in lipids and macromolecules combined. As described in the prior Q&A , most cellular water is unstructured and relatively free, but some is either loosely or tightly bound to proteins and other macromolecules. The most tightly bound of water protons have highly restricted motions with very short T2 values (< 1 ms), so that their signals may not be detected with conventional MRI techniques using TE values > 1 ms. Special techniques ( ultrashort TE imaging ) are required to record the signal from these protons. Lipids . Triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and free fatty acids are nonpolar and largely immiscible with water, being stored in specialized fat cells (adipocytes) or as vacuoles/inclusions in other cells. Such fats exist in a semi-liquid state, with slightly restricted motions of their long side chains resulting in short T1 values (a few hundred ms) and moderate to short T2 values (a few dozen ms). Fats are also abundant in cell membrane bi-layers, over half of which is phosphatidylcholine, which has more restricted motions. Lipid-containing cell membranes and myelin have highly restricted motions and T2 values shorter than 1 ms, with signals decaying too quickly to be detected on routine MR imaging. Small organic molecules . MR signals are emitted from a wide range of amino acids, sugars, organic acids, low-molecular weight proteins, and the like. These are the primary subject of MR spectroscopy. However, their concentrations are several hundred fold smaller than that of water protons, so their contributions to the overall MR signal is insignificant. In order to observe and measure them in MRS, the water signal must be suppressed. Macromolecules . This category includes both large intracellular proteins as well as extracellular connective tissues such as collagen. All macromolecules have H-containing components (e.g., methyl, amide, and methylene groups) from which MR signals may arise. The protons on s maller proteins (say<20 kDa) can more easily rotate and diffuse within cells and possess only moderately short T2 values allowing them to be observable in solution. Larger macromolecules become more immobile and are forced into globular shapes due to cytoplasmic crowding. Their H nuclei have highly restricted motions, being subject to the static and low frequency magnetic fields from neighboring nuclei and paramagnetic ions. Such large macromolecular protons typically have very short T2 values hence may be invisible on conventional MR pulse sequences with TE values longer than 1 ms, thus belonging to the \"dark pool\" described in the next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/which-hs-produce-signal.html"}

Acoustic pressure in the human auditory range, dB(A), from various noise sources As described in a prior Q&A , the vibration of gradient coils due to rapidly switched electrical currents produces sound waves during routine MR imaging. Some sequences (especially echo-planar imaging) generate sound pressures as high as 110-130 dB. In general, 3T scanners are noisier than those operating at 1.5T. In addition to being painful, acoustic noise at the higher end of this range may cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. Even noise of lower intensity may cause anxiety or distress in patients, especially infants, young children, and the elderly. This may manifest as patient motion artifacts and degraded image quality. Short-term exposure to intense (100+ dB) noise may result in temporary threshold shifts (TTS) , impaired hearing that typically lasts 15 minutes or less. However, some MR patients have experienced TTS with tinnitus lasting days or weeks. More significant are permanent threshold shifts (PTS) , typically caused by noise levels  130-140 dB. These result from disturbances in microcirculation to the organ of Corti with ischemic cell death. Children have a lower sensitivity for hearing damage, and restricting exposure to less than 120 dB is recommended. At present there are no precisely agreed upon limits for sound exposure related to MRI. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has defined permissible noise exposures for workers based on length of exposure. Applying these limits to typical MRI timeframes, noise exposures should not exceed 115 dB for 15 minutes of exposure down to 105 dB for 60 minutes. At no time should peak noise exposure exceed 140 dB. The UK limits are about 5 dB more stringent. In any case, there is unanimous agreement that ear protection should be offered to all patients (and accompanying family members) undergoing MRI examinations. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requires that ear protection should reduce exposure levels in MRI to below 99 dB. (Typical foam earplugs provide approximately 25 dB of noise reduction).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/acoustic-noise.html"}

Accuracy of each of these measurements can be determined using test phantoms as described below.

Laser Alignment and Table Position Before performing any slice or geometric measurements, the phantom should be placed in a head holder or other stable device and perfectly squared to the scanner bore using a bubble level. The table is then advanced and so that the patient alignment laser falls on the external landmark representing the phantom's exact center. After pressing \"Advance to Scan\" (or a similar button) the table and phantom will be moved into the magnet's isocenter. A sagittal scan of the phantom at this time will reveal a set of alignment bars whose positions can be measured with a cursor to verify accuracy of the laser-table position system. Sagittal image of ACR phantom with crosshair positioned at top of middle bar. This should lie within 2 mm of the anatomic center as established by laser alignment. Slice Thickness and Profile Difference between actual and ideal slice profiles. FWHM = full width at half maximum The first thing to recognize is that slices in MRI are constructed from a limited number of Fourier frequency components and hence are never perfectly rectangular. They have a bell-curve profiles with wider bases and narrower central peaks. Slice thickness is defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) signal intensity as shown in the diagram left. The most common method to estimate slice thickness is to use a phantom containing triangular ramps or wedges whose surfaces are oriented at a known angle (  ) to the plane of the slice. When a slice passes through the ramp, it produces a stretched \"shadow\" image whose FWHM can be estimated. The slice thickness ( THK ) is then: Slice thickness tolerances should generally be less than 10% on a well-functioning scanner (although the ACR allows up to 20% and still meet accreditation). The usual cause of slice thickness failure is RF-amplifier non-linearity with distorted pulse shapes. Other causes include problems anywhere else along the RF transmission chain, including cables, switches, and coils. All require troubleshooting by an MR service engineer. An MR phantom containing a triangular wedge. Full width half maximum (FWHM) of that portion of the test image where the slice exits the wedge is used to estimate actual slice thickness (THK) by simple trigonometry. Slice Position Use of opposing ramps in a phantom to determine slice position accuracy. Slice position accuracy tests how well the actual locations of slices differ from their prescribed locations. The standard method uses two oppositely-directed wedges. A slice passing through the exact center of overlap should result in two bars of nearly equal length in the phantom image. If the slice is malpositioned off-center, the two bars will be unequal in length. As for slice thickness measurements, slice positioning should ideally be within 10% tolerance limits. Slice position inaccuracies most frequently arise from operator error, table position/laser malalignment, bad gradient calibration, or poor B o inhomogeneity.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/slice-parameters.html"}

Bandwidth (BW) is the range of frequencies (measured in Hz) involved in the transmission or reception of an electronic signal. In MRI the term may be used to refer to the frequencies associated either with RF-excitation ( transmitter bandwidth , tBW ) or signal reception ( receiver bandwidth , rBW ). When not specified, the generic term \"bandwidth\" usually refers to receiver bandwidth, the subject of this page. Concepts surrounding RF-bandwidth will be discussed in a later Q&A. Recall that one dimension of an image is typically frequency-encoded by applying a spatially-varying gradient ( G f ) in that direction. This gradient slightly alters the precession frequencies as shown in the adjacent image. In this example the voxels at the extreme left side of the image resonate at 64,000,000 Hz while those at the far right resonate at 64,050,000 Hz. The total rBW is therefore 50,000 Hz. This value is an operator-selectable parameter, chosen by the technologist before the scan begins. Available values for total receiver BW range from about 5-100 kHz with 50kHz being typical. This total bandwidth is apportioned to pixels along the frequency-encoding direction equally. The width ( w ) of each pixel, in turn, is determined by two additional operator-selected parameters: the field-of-view in the frequency-encoding direction ( FOV f ) and the number of frequency-encoding steps ( N f ) . BW per pixel = Total BW  N f MR manufacturers have slightly different methods for defining receiver bandwidth. GE Healthcare uses the total bandwidth across the entire image, while Siemens and Canon use bandwidth per pixel (Px). In the example above, GE would report a rBW = 50 kHz regardless of the spatial resolution chosen. Siemens and Toshiba would calculate BW on a per pixel basis. So for N f = 256 they would report the BW to be 50,000/256 or 195 Hz/Px. Philips has a somewhat obtuse way of prescribing bandwidth - the \"fat/water shift\" in pixels. At 1.5T the resonant frequencies of fat and water protons differ by about 220 Hz causing them to refocus in slightly different positions in the image. This is known as the chemical shift artifact and will be explained much more completely in a future Q&A . Continuing the example above, a BW of 195 Hz/pixel at 1.5T would be reported by Philips as 220/195 = 1.1 pixels (Px). At 3.0T the chemical shift difference is about 440 Hz, so the Philips BW at this field would be reported as 2.2 pixels. At the \"nuts and bolts\" level, receiver BW is the same as the digitization rate of the MR signal . The dwell time ( t d ) is the interval between digitized samples. This, in turn, is defined by the sampling time ( t s ) and the number of complex samples ( n s ) measured. Continuing the above example, if 256 samples were acquired in 5.12 ms, the dwell time ( t d ) would be 5.12 ms/256 = 20 s. This would result in a total receiver BW of 1/20 s = 50,000 Hz.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/receiver-bandwidth.html"}

Denis Le Bihan, father of modern diffusion imaging, coined the term intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) in the 1980s to refer to the microscopic translation of water molecules within a voxel during an MR experiment. When gradients are applied during evolution of the MR signal, IVIM causes spin dephasing and signal loss. If the gradients are relatively strong , IVIM-induced signal losses are primarily due to diffusion  the Brownian motion of water molecules in and around cells. When weaker gradients are used, however, a second IVIM mechanism also contributes to signal loss  microcirculation of blood in the capillary network. Microscopic perfusion effects have been largely ignored in the 25 years since Le Bihan's seminal papers, but have recently enjoyed a renaissance in what is now known as IVIM imaging . If diffusion-only effects are considered, MR signal intensity ( S ) relative to baseline ( S o ) without diffusion-sensitizing gradients can be expressed as S = S o e  bD or S / S o = e  bD where D is the apparent (or measured) diffusion coefficient and b is a factor reflecting the strength and duration of the pulsed diffusion gradients. Under this model, a semilogarithmic plot of signal attenuation ln( S / S o ) vs b should be a straight line with slope = D . Deviation of the expected MR signal in DWI from a mono-exponential model. At low b -values IVIM effects due to microscopic perfusion must be considered (red), while at high b -values kurtosis effects must be considered (green). When careful signal measurements are made using a large number of different b -values, however, considerable departures from this simplified mono-exponential model are observed. At low b -values ( i.e.,  300  500 s/mm) the signal attenuation is greater (and the calculated ADC higher) than expected due to increased IVIM loses from microscopic perfusion. At larger b -values (  10001500 s/mm), signal attenuation is often less than expected, an effect due to the non-Gaussian shape (kurtosis) of the diffusion probability distribution further discussed in the next Q&A . The IVIM model as originally proposed by Le Bihan et al takes into account both diffusion and perfusion effects using the following bi-exponential model S/S o = fe b(D+D*) + (1f)e bD Enlarged area of graph showing D* vs D Here f (dimensionless) is the perfusion fraction , the percent of a voxel volume occupied by capillaries. Conversely (1f) reflects the extravascular space where only diffusion effects (with apparent diffusion coefficient D ) take place. The parameter D* is called the pseudodiffusion coefficient and reflects dephasing due to perfusion in semi-randomly organized capillaries. D* is sometimes referred to as ADC fast or ADC high while D is sometimes called ADC slow or ADC low . Depending on the steepness of the initial portion of the curve, (which in turn depends on capillary density and perfusion), D* may be 5-10x greater than D . By acquiring DWI images at multiple b -values and fitting the data to above equation, it is possible to estimate f , D , and D* and create maps for each. Typically between 6 and 10 data sets are obtained with b -values ranging between 0 and 1000 s/mm , with at least half the measurements performed at less than 250 s/mm . Some interesting results of IVIM imaging have been reported for tumors of the prostate, liver, and soft tissues, where perfusion fractions have been shown to correlate with other methods of assessing vascularity. However, considerable errors occur in the estimation of D *, which I personally feel are unreliable, varying too much among centers and studies. Not only D *, but all IVIM parameter estimates are affected by motion, noise, and secretory physiologic processes (such as glandular and renal tubular flows) that cannot easily be distinguished from capillary perfusion. I thus remain a little skeptical for now as to what extent IVIM imaging will find a role in our future imaging armamentarium.

From a prior Q&A we developed a simplified equation to express specific absorption rate (SAR) in terms of several other tissue related and technical factors, including:  (tissue conductivity), A (patient cross sectional area),  (RF frequency, which is proportional to B o main field strength by the Larmor equation), B 1 (the intensity of the RF field, which is proportional to flip angle ), and D (the duty cycle, or percent time RF is \"on\" during a given pulse sequence. Considering these factors leads to a better understanding of what sequences produce the highest levels of SAR and provide a wide range of potential strategies for reducing it. Since SAR is proportional to the square of the flip angle, sequences with the highest SAR levels tend to be those containing a large number of 180 refocusing-pulses applied over a short period of time. Fast (Turbo) Spin Echo is the archetype, followed by the Inversion Recovery family. Saturation pulses of all types (e.g., Fat-Sat, Spatial Sat, and especially Magnetization Transfer) may cause SAR limits to be exceeded. As a rule, Gradient Echo sequences produce much lower SAR effects (as they use gradient reversals rather than refocusing pulses to rephase the MR signal). Exceptions to this rule are GRE sequences performed at extremely short TR's, such as bSSFP/FIESTA and TOF MR, the latter of which also include traveling saturation bands that add to the SAR load. Methods for Reducing SAR Avoid or minimize use of high SAR sequences (in the box above) . If they must be used, interleave them in the protocol with lower SAR sequences to allow tissue cooling in between. Use Gradient Echo instead of Spin Echo sequences where possible.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Video Endoscopy Capsules PillCam is a popular video capsule endoscopy device produced by Medtronic (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Several other medical equipment companies produce similar devices, including the following  CapsoCam (CapsoVision) , ENDOCAPSULE (Olympus), OMOM (Jinshan), and MiroCam (IntroMedic)  but the generic term \"pillcam\" has become ubiquitous when referring to these devices (akin to the use of the word \"kleenex\" for any tissue paper). Video endoscopy capsules contain a small battery, camera, and transmitter circuitry. Some models are optimized for the small bowel or colon. The devices take thousands of pictures as they pass through the gastrointestinal tract before being eliminated in the feces. Occasionally the capsules will be retained in GI tract or a patient may present for MR imaging before the device has passed. Abdomen x-ray with two (!) retained PillCams The official answer to \"Can I scan someone with a retained PillCam or similar device?\" must surely be \"No\", as all extant product literature considers them MR Unsafe on the basis that they might cause thermal or physical injury to the GI tract. However, little if any testing of these devices in MRI has been conducted and several reports now exist of patients inadvertently scanned without any ill health effects. In one case, some \"harm\" occurred in that the imaging data was erased from the device. The capsules will also create a small-to-moderate sized susceptibility artifact. I therefore suspect that in the future, MR scanning with a PillCam in place will not be contraindicated, only discouraged. As an accessory, Medtronic also sells Agile and Patency capsules consisting of a small RFID chip surrounded by a dissolvable core. These may be used in patients with suspected strictures demonstrate patency of the gastrointestinal tract prior to ingesting the PillCam itself. The Agile and Patency capsules are considered MR Unsafe , not because of any danger to the patient but because the RFID chip could malfunction in the MR field. Other Capsule Devices In addition to the PillCam  family and their competitors, several other less common ingested capsule devices should be mentioned. For the same reasons as the PillCam, all of the following are also considered MR Unsafe : Core Temperature Monitoring Capsules These single-use, ingestible capsules measure core body temperature (during the 1-5 day period they are within the body) and may be useful to monitor athletes and persons working in high-temperature environments. Several brands are commercially available: CorTem p  ( HQ Inc ), VitalSense  ( Mini Mitter ), myTemp  , and e-Celsius  ( BodyCap ). In addition to the swallowed capsule, some systems have dermal patch receivers that are also MR Unsafe . CorTemp Monitoring Capsule pH and Pressure Monitoring Capsules The Bravo Esophageal Monitoring Capsule (Medtronic) measures pH and pressure in the distal esophagus. Placed endoscopically and held by suction, the capsule stays attached to the esophagus for several days, then spontaneously detaches to pass out through the GI tract. To ensure the capsule has been eliminated from the body, Medtronic warns that MRI should not be performed within 30 days of its placement. The SmartPill  (Medtronic) provides pH, pressure, and position data on its transit through the GI tract. The device is marketed as part of a system for quantitative assessment of gastro-intestinal motility. Bravo pH Monitoring Capsule SmartPill Motility System Drug Delivery Capsules IntelliCap Electronic Capsule Although not in wide use, these devices represent a new class of ingestible capsules that hold, monitor, and release medications into the GI tract. They may also contain pH, location, and temperature sensors. Examples include the Abilify MyCite System (Proteus/ Otsuka), the ID-Cap System (etectRx), and the IntelliCap  (Medimetrics/Philips). MRI should not be performed with these in place. References Bandorski D, Kurniawan N, Baltes P, et al. Contraindications for video capsule endoscopy . World J Gastroenterol 2016; 22:9898-9908.

In brief for most tissues, T1 increases and T2 doesn't change very much as field strength increases. This can be understood by reviewing the principles underlying dipole-dipole interactions, the primary mechanism responsible for T1 and T2 relaxation rates for H nuclei. T1 is the shortest when the molecular tumbling rate (also known as the correlation time  c ), is approximately equal to the Larmor frequency. Molecules tumbling faster or slower are less efficient at spin-lattice relaxation and have longer T1s. T2 relaxation accompanies all T1 relaxation processes. Additionally, T2 occurs in a secular fashion (without T1 or energy exchange) when molecular motion slows to well below the Larmor frequency. Hence solids, macromolecules, and bound water molecules rotate slowly and have short T2 values. T2 progressively increases with molecular tumbling rate. In the limit (pure liquids like CSF) T1=T2 and both are several seconds in length. The overall T1 effect can be thought of as a \"Goldilock's\" phenomenon. For the shortest T1 possible, the molecular rotation rate must be neither \"too long\" nor \"too short\", but \"just right.\" Free water has a wide range of tumbling rates and so most molecules in this state are inefficient at T1 relaxation. Hence free water has long T1 values. Water in hydration layers around proteins is more restricted and a significantly greater fraction of H nuclei rotate near the Larmor frequency with correspondingly shorter T1 values. The Larmor frequency is directly proportional to field strength ( B o ), so changing the field strength changes the Goldilock \"T1 sweet spot\". But this affects different substances differently. For protons in highly mobile molecules (such as free water), changing field strength (and hence the Larmor frequency) will not appreciably alter the fraction of protons moving at this frequency. Thus neither T1 nor T2 will be much affected, at least over the range of fields used for MR imaging. For protons in molecules with intermediate or low mobility, however, shifting the magnetic field to a higher value may significantly decrease the fraction of these protons able to interact at the new (higher) Larmor frequency. As a result, T1 will increase as field strength increases. For most biological tissues, empirical measurements suggest that T1 increases approximately as B o 1/3 . Therefore, measured T1 values of most tissues will approximately double as field strength is raised from 0.3 T to 3.0 T and will increase by about 25% between 1.5T to 3.0T. T2 relaxation resulting from static or slowly fluctuating fields will not be much affected by a shift of the Larmor frequency. T2 relaxation in intermediate and low mobility protons accompanying T1 relaxation will be somewhat prolonged by an increase in field strength, paralleling the lengthening of T1. On the other hand, some mechanisms of T2 relaxation (such as chemical exchange and molecular diffusion) may actually be more efficient at higher fields and therefore cause a reduction in T2 values. This is especially seen at 7.0T in the brain near structures (like the substantia nigra) that contain large amounts of iron. Averaging the results among all tissue types it can be concluded that T2 doesn't really change much over the range of field strengths used for routine clinical MR imaging (0.2T to 3.0T) but does shorten at very high fields.

Permanent epicardial pacemaker in a child with congenital heart disease From Costa et al under CC-BY Temporary Epicardial Pacemakers Epicardial pacing wires Temporary epicardial pacemakers and wires are commonly placed after open heart surgery to treat possible arrhythmias that might develop in the postoperative period. The leads are passed through the mediastinum and subcutaneously to protrude through the skin where they are connected to an external pulse generator. After the patient proves rhythmically stable (typically 2 - 14 days postoperatively), the external unit is removed and the wires are manually pulled from the chest. Although usually extracted successfully, it is not rare for the wires to break off under the skin and be retained. Because of their short length, absence of large loops, and subcutaneous location, such retained epicardial pacing wire fragments are not considered a contraindication to MR imaging. In the rare situation where the wires have not been removed or broken off but are still intact and protruding though the skin, we have on rare occasions scanned such patients safely. (This assumes that the patient is not dependent on the extracorporeal pacemaker). With the external pulse generator removed, the protruding wires should be lifted and straightened to lie parallel to the long axis of the patient. The wires should be separated from each other and padded so they do not touch the patient's skin (to reduce risk of cutaneous burns).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/epicardial-pacersleads.html"}

Classification of ASL techniques All arterial spin labeling (ASL) pulse sequences consist of two components: 1) a preparation module to magnetically label/tag flowing blood, and 2) a readout module to generate paired images of the target tissue under \"control\" and \"tagged\" conditions. ASL methods may be classified as to how each of these modules is constructed. The earliest ASL techniques inverted flowing spins using continuous radiofrequency (RF) irradiation in conjunction with magnetic field gradients applied in the direction of blood flow. Known by the acronym CASL (Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling) , these sequences were difficult to implement on commercial scanners and produced significant tissue heating. By the late 1990s CASL methods were largely abandoned in favor of a group of methods using pulsed irradiation, known collectively as PASL (Pulsed Arterial Spin Labeling) . PASL techniques can be further divided into those that label spins asymmetrically with respect to the plane of imaging ( EPISTAR , PICORE ) or symmetrically ( FAIR ). More recently a hybrid form has been developed, pCASL (pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling) , that uses a long series of short RF-pulses together with a strong slice-selection gradient. pCASL thus combines favorable features of CASL (high signal-to-noise) with those of PASL (lower energy deposition). Today most commercially available ASL products are based on pCASL or a PASL variant. In the earliest ASL methods readout (imaging) was confined to a single slice obtained with an echo-planar gradient echo technique. Multi-slice methods soon followed, as well as image formation using fast (turbo) spin echoes and turbo gradient spin echoes. Both multi-slice 2D and 3D methods are available. 2D image acquisition is less sensitive to head motion and is probably better than 3D for blood flow quantification. For optimal image quality, both a prescan as well as field mapping are recommended. A disadvantage of 2D methods is that more distal slices have longer labeling delays than proximal slices, resulting in slice-to-slice variations in signal due to relaxation effects. 3D methods take slightly longer than 2D methods to perform, but are easier to set up. They offer higher signal-to-noise and better spatial resolution, as well as a fixed labeling delay across all slices. At present 3D techniques are not compatible with fMRI studies as perfusion changes over short time intervals cannot be obtained. Background suppression is also generally required that reduces perfusion signal and may confound calculation of absolute blood flows. Technical details and more complete descriptions of the major ASL sequences are covered in the next several Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/asl-methods-overview.html"}

Which can be violated with the least risk? Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding From time to time we encounter a patient that clinically would benefit from an MRI scan yet does not meet all the strict conditions listed in the previous two Q&As. As all treatments in medicine involve benefit vs risk, it is worth considering how stringent one should be concerning relative contraindications. Recent Implants (< 6 weeks) Existing guidelines recommend waiting 6 weeks after implantation to allow the electrode lead tips to acquire a fibrous sheath and thereby secure purchase in the myocardium. To me, this restriction is reminiscent of the 6-week MRI delay once required for cardiac stents that has long since been rescinded. Support for scanning patients with pacemakers less than 6 weeks implanted can be found in the papers by Friedman (2013) and Russo (2017) below. I personally have no problem recommending MRI immediately after implantation or anytime during this 6 week window, provided their lead voltages and impedances have been stable. (Admittedly, I might be a little more cautious for leadless pacemakers, as they could become dangerous emboli if dislodged). Broken or Abandoned Intravascular/Intracardiac Leads The primary concern here is lead heating, resulting in endocardial burns, secondarily induced arrhythmias, damage to adjacent leads, and changes in lead capture and sensing parameters. The recent studies by Higgins (2014) Schaller (2021) and Greenhill (2024) give some comfort that such patients can be safely scanned at 1.5T. If you do choose to scan such patients, try to keep the average SAR  1.5 W/kg. Note that these restrictions do not apply to retained temporary epicardial leads that may be safely scanned (see separate Q&A ). Fractured pacemaker lead Mismatched Leads and Generator Occasionally a patient will present with a CIED rendered non-conditional because of a mismatch between manufacturers of the lead(s) and generator. This most commonly occurs when older generators are replaced with a new device and the original wires are left in place. Although little published literature exists concerning this configuration, a recent study by Okasha et al. found no adverse events in 35 patients studied at 1.5T. Higher SAR Limits Notwithstanding my comments in the previous section, many authorities believe that higher SAR limits (such as those applicable to First Level Controlled Operating Mode ) are fully acceptable to use with both conditional and non-conditional CIEDs. In small series reported, no adverse events from such higher SAR limits have been observed. Until more research is available, however, I prefer to keep our studies within the (lower SAR) Normal Operating Mode . Different Field Strengths and Magnet Configurations A common question is whether non-conditional CIEDs can be scanned at 3.0T. It is true that a number of MR-Conditional CIEDs have been approved for 3.0T. Data is largely lacking for non-Conditional CIED at 3.0T, so why risk it? Let's face it, 3.0T is great but nearly every diagnosis usually be made very well on a well-tuned 1.5T scanner. Whole-body scanners operating below 1.5T are mostly non-cylindrical in design with vertical magnetic fields. As even MR-Conditional CIEDs are not approved in this scenario and very little research exists, it would be prudent to avoid such scanners and locate a suitable wide-bore 1.5T system. Small dedicated head and extremity scanners, however, whose fields are relatively confined, are generally safe to use with all CIEDs.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/violating-the-conditions.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Sternal Wires Closure of a midline sternotomy incision using wires is the standard method used for decades. As the wires are typically made of nonferromagnetic stainless steel, titanium, or alloys, they are MR Conditional but can be scanned immediately after placement at all field strengths up to 3T. This is true even if the wires are broken. I am aware of no clinical reports of burns or discomfort of patients with sternal wires undergoing MRI, but theoretical models suggest that temperature increases of up to 10C may occur secondary to the antenna effect and capacitive mutual coupling between wires in certain situations. This is more likely to occur at higher field strengths and when the sutures are not simple loops, but placed in figure-of-8 or more complex configuration.

Some wires and tubing may pass from below along trenches in the floor. The walls of the magnet room are constructed in layers and perform several independent functions: magnetic shielding to confine the fringe field; acoustic shielding to restrict noise transmission to the control room and beyond; radio-frequency shielding to prevent electromagnetic noise from entering or leaving the room. The floor must be able to support the considerable weight of the magnet, table, and accessories. The weight of a typical 1.5 T cylindrical superconducting scanner is on the order of 10,000 lbs (4,500 kg) while a 3.0 T scanner may weigh up to 17,000 lbs (7,500 kg). The weight of a permanent low-field magnet may be over three times higher than a 1.5 T superconducting scanner, up to 35,000 lbs (16,000 kg).

Unlike the spoiled-GRE case, however, the effects of each of these on image contrast is not quite so intuitive nor easily predictable.

The final MR signal is therefore a summation of FIDs, secondary spin echoes and stimulated echoes that accumulate over over many cycles. In spite of this complexity, a few basic statements concerning image contrast in these sequences are possible. TE controls T2*-weighting Just as with fully spoiled sequences, GRASS/FISP dephases and rephases an FID-like signal into a gradient-recalled echo. This gradient echo exponentially decays with time constant T2*. The longer the echo time ( TE ), the more time for this decay and lower the overall signal. Just as with spoiled GRE sequences, therefore, lengthening TE in GRASS/FISP increases T2*-weighting. Long TR or Multi-slice mode: Spoiled-GRE Behavior Effect of TR . At long TRs (> 250 ms) T2* decay prevents a transverse steady state from becoming established, converting GRASS/FISP to SPGR/FLASH behavior. Both images have TE=7 and =60. Image on left has TR=40; Image on right has TR = 400. GRASS/FISP contrast is perhaps the easiest to understand in cases where the assumptions of a coherent transverse steady state break down. For example, when TR is much longer than T2* (e.g., TR > 250 ms for most tissues), natural T2*-processes intrinsically result in complete decay of the transverse magnetization between RF-pulses. The GRASS/FISP sequence then behaves as a spoiled-GRE sequence whose contrast behavior has been described in a separate Q&A . Physiologic motion may also contribute to this intrinsic spoiling of the GRASS/FISP sequence. Thus flowing cerebrospinal fluid and blood may exhibit spoiled contrast behavior, even though stationary tissue remains in a steady-state free precession. Finally, operating the sequence in multi-slice mode (MPGR) also disrupts the development of coherent transverse magnetization and the sequence develops spoiled-GRE behavior. This will be discussed more fully in the next Q&A . Effect of Flip Angle (  ) Effect of Flip Angle () . Both images have TR=50 and TE=15. Left image with  = 15 shows spin-density-weighting. Right image with  = 90 shows T2/T1-weighting. For shorter values of TR , both a longitudinal and a transverse steady state become established with considerable mixing from pulse to pulse. As such, and image contrast is largely independent of TR and will be dictated principally by flip angle (). As will be explained below, low flip angles (<20) produce spin-density-weighted images, whereas larger flip angles (>45) result in contrast that is sensitive to the ratio T2/T1. In a prior Q&A I described how a low flip-angle pulse creates an appreciable transverse magnetization while disturbing the longitudinal magnetization only slightly. When  is small, therefore, most of the steady-state magnetization remains in the longitudinal direction, a phenomenon dependent primarily upon the trigonometric fact that cos   1 for small  (and hence essentially independent of tissue T1 or T2). Stated another way, the longitudinal magnetization will not change much after a small  pulse, and this is true regardless of what T1 or T2 may be. For low flip angles, therefore, image contrast depends primarily upon the equilibrium magnetization, which reflects the total number of spins in the sample. Hence low flip angles (  < 20) produce spin-density [H]-weighted images. When  is large, however, considerable interchange between the longitudinal and transverse magnetization components occurs with each RF-pulse. The net signal then depends strongly upon both T1 and T2 (or more explicitly, upon the ratio T2/T1). For most solid tissues, T1 is approximately 5-10 times longer than T2, but for fluids T2 and T1 are nearly equal. As flip angle increases, therefore, the signal from CSF and other fluids significantly increases because of this T2/T1 behavior. A summary of these image contrast manipulations appears in the table below. The reader should realize that terms such as \"T1-weighting\" and \"T2*-weighting\" are not strictly defined and that in a single image many different tissue contrasts may be present simultaneously. For example, some parts of a GRASS/FISP image may exhibit T1 contrast while other parts show T2/T1 contrast and spin-density weighting. Furthermore, the signal from water/CSF cannot be used as a simple and reliable guide to the type of weighting as it can in SE imaging. Water may be equally bright on spin-density-, T2*-, and T2/T1-weighted steady-state GRE images.

Equations describing the magnetic translational force ( F z ) and magnetic rotational force/torque ( T ) on an ellipsoidal metallic object have been developed in a prior Q&A . Here f() and g() are functions that depend on the object's intrinsic susceptibility (  ), shape-dependent demagnetizing factors ( N a and N d ), and angle the object makes with the external magnetic field (  ). The term  o  4 x 10 7 N/A is the magnetic constant , also known as the permeability of free space. For paramagnetic and weakly ferromagnetic materials with  < 1, f() =  and g() =   sin2. Further modifications of these equations are needed for materials that reach magnetic saturation or are permanently magnetized. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International , in their core document (F2503), created the categories MR Safe, MR Unsafe, and MR Conditional and developed the familiar icons associated with each. The ASTM has also proposed methods for measuring magnetic displacement force (F2052) and torque (F2213), standards incorporated into a more comprehensive publication by the International Standards Organization (ISO/TS:10974). ASTM Method for Measuring Translational Magnetic Force As shown in the diagram, the object in question is suspended by a string near the edge of the scanner bore (where the spatial gradient product B o  B o is largest). The angular displacement from vertical is then measured, and the translational force along the z -axis (along the direction of the main magnetic field) based on the weight of the object can then be calculated. If the deflection angle is less than 45, the magnetic force of the object is less than that of gravity, which ASTM considers conditionally safe for this parameter. ASTM method for measuring translational magnetic force ( F z ) on an object Even though the magnetic translational force on an implant may exceed that due to gravity, the implant may still be acceptable depending on the mechanical properties of nearby tissues and how tightly the implant is attached in the body. For example, a highly ferromagnetic orthopedic implant may still be conditionally safe provided it is firmly adhered to bone. For large deflection angles, small errors in angle measurement can produce large errors in the calculated translational force. In this scenario it is common to attach small lead weights to the center of mass of the object to reduce the deflection angle to a more desirable range (25  65 ). For tiny objects like clips, multiple duplicates taped together may be used. The ASTM method does not consider the shape of the object or the configuration in which it hangs. For example, an elongated object in a field below magnetic saturation will experience a stronger force when aligned with B o than when perpendicular. Likewise, the magnetic torque on the object is not considered, but this will affect the angle of suspension. ASTM Methods for Measuring Magnetic Torque The ASTM offers 5 different methods for measuring magnetic torque on an implant, ranging from simple/qualitative to complex/quantitative. The first three methods (Calculation, Surface, and Suspension) are suitable for objects demonstrating <45 displacements in the translational force test (and which are therefore expected to demonstrate only minor torques. The last two methods (Pulley and Torsion Spring) require more sophisticated setup but are quantitative. The Calculation Based on Magnetically Induced Force Method is just what the name implies  using the F z value measured from the Translational Test (F2052) above to set upper limits on the expected torque. The maximum torque, T max , is calculated to be If the magnetic saturation value ( B sat ) of the implant material is unknown then the value 2.2T for pure iron is used. In the Low Friction Surface Method , the propensity of an object to reorient itself with respect to the magnetic field on a smooth plane is noted. This is an all-or-none test. If the object does not move when the plane is rotated, then the torque is considered small, being less than the frictional force times the length of the object. If the object moves, however, then a more sophisticated test quantitative estimate of torque is required. In the Suspension Method , the implant is suspended from a string a magnet isocenter (where the B o field is maximal and spatial gradients are zero). After manually twisting the object out of alignment with the field, notation is made concerning the degree to which the object seeks to realign. A subjective assessment using a 5-point scale is often employed (0 = no motion, 2 = moderate, implant aligns gradually with magnetic field, and 4 = very strong torque demonstrating \"rapid and forceful\" field alignment.) In the Pulley Method, the implant is placed on a platform in near magnet isocenter which is free to rotate via a string and low-friction pulley apparatus. The string is pulled and the object rotated by 360  with the maximum force F m noted. The object is removed and the rotation repeated to determine the maximum frictional force ( F f ) of the pulley system alone. The Torque ( T ) then equals R(F m F f ) where R is the radius. ASTM F2213 compatible Pulley Method apparatus for measuring magnetic torque. ASTM F2213 Torsion Spring Method for measuring magnetic torque. The final technique, the Torsion Spring Method , was the only torque measurement standard ASTM recognized up until the current (2017) edition. This method thus has a long history and is considered by many to be the most accurate for implants where an appreciable torque is expected. As shown in the illustration left, the implant is secured by strong tape to a tray suspended between two calibrated torsion springs (blue canisters) and placed at magnet isocenter. The apparatus is then rotated in 10  increments using a turning gear (not pictured) over a full 360  rotation and the maximum deflection angle (   ) recorded. The magnetically induced torque ( T ) equals k   , where k is the torsional spring constant. The calibrated spring system thus allows a numerical value for torque to be obtained, in units such as N-m. If the maximal torque recorded by either the Pulley Method or Torsion Spring Method is less than the longest dimension of the object times its weight, then the magnetically induced torque is less than the worst case torque due to gravity. The ASTM then considers the implant conditionally safe on the basis of torque. As with translational forces, objects with torques exceeding the gravity limit may still be acceptable depending on the mechanical properties of nearby tissues and the tightness of the implant's attachment.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/forcetorque-testing.html"}

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) methods use RF-pulses to magnetically \" tag\" protons in arterial blood prior to their entry into an organ or capillary bed. When these labeled water protons enter a new anatomic region they can be recognized by their unique magnetic signature and used to produce an arteriogram. ASL was originally developed to measure tissue perfusion, the subject of several later Q&A's, but here the focus is on its use in MR angiography. The simplest form of MRA with ASL is called the Outflow Method . The sequence begins with two 180-RF pulses applied in close succession. The first 180-pulse is non-selective, meaning it inverts the entire background regardless of location. The second 180-pulse is spatially-selective, applied to restore magnetization in the region from which the \"fresh\" blood will flow. During the inversion time ( TI ) interval, this fully magnetized (\"fresh\") blood will enter the anatomic area of interest. Signal generation is then initiated using either a 3D balanced-SSFP or FSE sequence to produce the MRA. In brief, two phenomena are occurring simultaneously during the inversion period of the MRA-ASL sequence. Stationary tissue, whose magnetization has been initially inverted by the first nonselective 180-pulse, is recovering via T1-relaxation back toward zero. Tagged blood, whose magnetization has been restored to M o by the second 180-pulse, is flowing out of the tag region into the imaging volume. TI is chosen to coincide with the null point for stationary tissues, which at 1.5 is typically in the 1000-1200 msec range. ASL Outflow method for portal MR venography. Blood within the \"Selective\" area receives two 180-pulses and is tagged (non-suppressed) producing signal during MRA readout. As with other MRA methods, many variations are possible. These include applying additional saturation pulses to suppress signals from the aorta or vena cava. Canon offers ASL-MRA with a \"Tag-on/Tag-off\" option using image subtraction to improve background suppression. Separate arterial and venous images are also possible. These features come at the expense of increased imaging time and motion artifacts due to image subtraction. Vessel-selective 3D ASL-MRA applied to an arteriovenous malformation showing contributions to the nidus from each major vascular supply (from Suzuki under CC-BY) ASL has several intrinsic limitations, and is not currently as widely used as many other MRA techniques. First, because ASL-MRA relies on the replacement of saturated blood by tagged blood, reasonably high arterial velocities are required for success. ASL methods may thus not be suitable for MRA of vessels with significant stenoses.

The relaxivity of an MR contrast agent reflects how the relaxation rates of a solution change as a function of concentration [C]. Since a contrast agent may affect the two relaxation rates (1/T1 and 1/T2) individually, there are two corresponding relaxivities, denoted r 1 and r 2 . By definition 1/T1 = r 1  [C] and 1/T2 = r 2  [C] Since T1 and T2 are given in seconds and [C] is measured in millimoles per liter , r 1 and r 2 have units of L/mmol-s . The relaxation rates of a contrast agent in solution are obtained by graphing changes in relaxation rates (1/T1) and (1/T2) at different concentrations. The slopes of the lines represent r 1 and r 2. Relaxivity depends on the temperature, field strength, and substance in which the contrast agent is dissolved. For contrast agents in clinical use, it is typical to cite r 1 and r 2 values at 1.5T in plasma at body temperature (37C). r 1 and r 2 relaxivities for commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents obtained in plasma at 37C at 1.5T (data from Rohrer et al and Robic et al) The table left illustrates that all gadolinium contrast agents are not the same, showing considerable variability among r 1 and r 2 values. Agents with the larger relaxivities are those with higher molecular weights, higher protein bonding, or both. Excluding the liver agent Eovist, MultiHance has the highest T1 relaxivity of all the general extracellular agents, making it optimal for detecting enhancement on T1-weighted images at standard doses.

As described in a previous Q&A , magnetization transfer (MT) is the physical process by which macromolecules and their closely associated water molecules (the \"bound\" pool) cross-relax with protons in the free water pool. The interaction between the two pools can be modulated by applying radiofrequency (RF) energy exclusively to the bound pool using specially designed off-resonance MT pulse(s) . Some of this deposited energy is then transferred to the free water pool primarily via dipole-dipole interactions. Depending on the degree of coupling between the pools, the free water pool becomes partially saturated. If the free water pool is subsequently imaged using routine RF pulses and gradients, its signal will be reduced secondary to an MT effect. I personally find it helpful to think of MT pulses as \"macromolecule sat pulses\" which selectively suppress tissues with significant water-macromolecule interactions. The suppression of background tissue by MT pulses makes the technique especially useful as an adjunct to MR angiography (MRA). Small vessel detail and overall image contrast are significantly improved in time of flight (TOF) MRA when MT pulses are employed. Time of flight MRA without (left) and with (right) MT suppression. Note better visualization of small vessels after MT pulse. Magnetization transfer techniques are equally effective for both non-contrast and contast-enhanced MRA. Because gadolinium (Gd) enhancement is caused by a water-Gd ion interaction (not macromolecular cross-relaxation), MT pulses suppress the signal from background tissues and render Gd-enhanced areas more conspicuous. Limitations and disadvantages of MT-assisted MRA include: 1) a slight prolongation of imaging time (extra time is required to perform the MT pulses); and 2) tissue heating due to energy deposition from the MT pulses. Notwithstanding these limitations, MT pulses are widely used in clinical MRA studies, especially of the brain.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/magnetization-transfer.html"}

Parallel imaging (PI) is beset by the same types of artifacts that affect \"regular\" MR imaging: noise, motion, aliasing, chemical shift, Gibbs, susceptibility, RF-interference, etc. However, these artifacts may have slightly different appearances because they are acted upon by the complex PI reconstruction process, including generation of coil sensitivity maps, thresholding/masking, polynomial fitting, and estimation of spatial harmonics or weighting factors for image unfolding. Aliasing is a well-recognized cause of artifact in all types of MR imaging. Aliasing occurs whenever a signal is sampled at a rate that is not at least 2x greater than the band of frequencies contained within that signal. The usual type of aliasing artifact seen in non-PI MRI is a \"wraparound\" of anatomic structures, typically in the phase-encoding direction. The standard aliasing artifact and its remedies are described in several later Q&A's . The SENSE ghost is a particular type of aliasing artifact that occurs when the reconstructed field-of-view (FOV) is smaller than the imaged object. The SENSE ghost is a fold-over type artifact appearing in the middle (and sometimes edges) of the image along the phase-encoding direction. The SENSE Ghost The SENSE algorithm must consider all contributions to a reduced FOV pixel before the unfolding step is performed. When the FOV is too small, this amounts to ignoring signal contributions from outside the FOV with \"contamination\" of the imaged pixels. The SENSE algorithm is thus unable to unwrap this additional fold-over. Ghosts of the excluded peripheral tissue are replicated across the reconstructed image, equidistantly-spaced at a distance equal to the reduced FOV of the single-coil data. Motion artifacts in SENSE-type PI sequences may occur between the time of the calibration scan and image acquisition proper. The resultant artifact appears as a group of replicated edges in the phase-encode direction while the rest of the image has an unremarkable appearance. The replicated edges come from the brightest parts of the image -- typically subcutaneous fat whose signals dominate the calibration scan. If problematic, the solution is to repeat the calibration scan and imaging sequence after coaching the patient and better securing the offending body part. The use of autocalibrating PI sequences (like mSENSE) will also eliminate this particular motion artifact. Motion occurring between calibration phase and imaging in SENSE Noise in PI is often non-uniformly distributed Noise in parallel imaging is directly related to the use of higher acceleration factors (R). The unique feature about PI noise is that it is not uniformly distributed or constant across the image, but depends on a spatially dependent parameter known as the geometric (g) factor . This phenomenon is well demonstrated in the knee image (left) where bands of noise are projected across the anterior and posterior aspects of the image but spare the middle portion. This nonuniform noise distribution is more common with SENSE/ASSET than with GRAPPA/ARC methods. Several methods are available to minimize residual aliasing artifacts and noise enhancement in PI. The calibration can be readjusted (by repeating the coil sensitivity mapping for SENSE or acquiring more ACS lines for GRAPPA). If possible, try changing the phase-encoding axis to the direction along which there are the largest number of coil elements. Downward adjustment of the acceleration factor (R) will always help, albeit at the expense of increased imaging time. If 3D scanning is being used, it is generally better to accelerate in both phase- and slab (partition)-encoding directions. For example, if a total acceleration factor R =4 is desired, it is better to break this up by using R =2 in two directions than to use R =4 along a single axis. Advanced PI acquisition techniques such as CAIPIRINHA may also improve image quality by reducing the number of pixels that alias on top of one another.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/artifacts-in-pi.html"}

No consistent or convincing body of evidence has yet been assembled to suggest that short-term exposure to electromagnetic fields (such as the exposure that occurs during MR imaging) harms the developing fetus. The reader should be aware, however, that in a a few studies, prolonged and/or high-intensity exposure to electromagnetic radiation has been linked with some deleterious effects on embryogenesis, chromosomal structure, or fetal development. Such positive studies purport to have demonstrated: accelerated cleavage in sea urchin embryos, lower birth weights in rats, chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocyte cultures, altered bacterial mutation rates, modulation of mitosis frequency in slime molds, and malformations of chick and frog embryos. Nevertheless, far more studies have failed to demonstrate any measurable ill effects of electromagnetic fields on animal or human embryos. Therefore, at present, there is no conclusive scientific evidence to support a direct relationship between MRI exposure and disorders of embryogenesis. Of course, neither has it been proved that small or subtle effects do not occur. For this reason we do not cavalierly recommend MR imaging in pregnant patients, particularly if there is no overpowering clinical necessity for the scan or if an equivalent non-ionizing diagnostic technique (e.g., ultrasound) will suffice. Notwithstanding these cautions, we do not hesitate to scan a pregnant patient when such a study is medically indicated. Reasonable indications for an MR scan during pregnancy might include herniated disk, possible stroke, or complex suspected fetal abnormality. Considerable reassurance of MRI safety is provided by the JAMA paper by Ray et al (2016). In this population-based cohort study of more than 1.4 million pregnancies, non-contrast first-trimester MRI was not significantly associated with congenital anomaly, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Although the direct effects of RF irradiation in MRI may be harmless, localized heating of fetal tissues (caused by RF-induced currents) can indeed result in developmental anomalies (in animals) when the core body temperature is increased by 2-4 C. For this reason alone, everything possible should be done to minimize the specific absorption rate (SAR) while imaging a pregnant patient. Such strategies, discussed in another Q&A , include scanning only in \"Normal Operating Mode\", avoiding high SAR sequences, parallel transmission, and the use of saturation pulses. Additionally, although unproven, exposure of the fetus to loud noises should be avoided through the use of \"quiet gradients\" or similar acoustic reduction techniques. When an MRI has been ordered in a pregnant patient, either I or one of my resident physicians talks personally with her to obtain informed consent for imaging. We explain the concepts expressed in the first three paragraphs  that there are no proven harmful effects of MRI on the fetus. . . but the risk may not be zero. We also inform each patient that any alternative radiologic diagnostic tests (such as CT or myelography) would likely require using x-rays, and that the risks of ionizing radiation on the developing fetus is no less, and is probably greater, than the theoretical risks of MRI. In the final analysis, the most important factor in having a healthy baby is having a healthy mother. Gadolinium in pregnancy should be avoided if at all possible and used only after careful assessment of benefits v risk.

Most contrast-enhanced lymph node imaging to date has been performed with ferrite-containing nanoparticles (5-50 nm) known as ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxides (US-SPIOs or USPIOs) . After intravenous injection these nanoparticles are not immediately phagocytized by the liver and spleen, but remain in circulation for several hours. This long blood half-life allows the ultra-small iron agents time to penetrate the vascular endothelium and leak into the interstitium. Thereafter, the particles are cleared by lymphatics, draining into lymph nodes where they are captured and retained by macrophages/histiocytes (and potentially other sinus-lining endothelial cells) . Alternatively the particles may be injected intradermally or subcutaneously, with secondary drainage into lymphatic channels and uptake into regional lymph node chains. This is the MR equivalent of lymphoscintigraphy, a technique commonly used in nuclear medicine for staging cancer and identifying sentinel lymph nodes for surgical sampling. USPIOs act as negative (susceptibility) contrast agents, reducing signal intensity of normal lymph nodes on T2-weighted images rendering them dark. In theory, lymph nodes containing metastasis will remain bright or show only peripheral darkening. Limited clinical trials of these agents to date, however, have produced mixed results, with concern about high false positive rates for detection of metastases.

For an IR pulse sequence using fast spin-echo acquisition, signal intensity is nulled when TI is chosen so that the term Because CSF has a long intrinsic T1 value (3000-4000 ms), its TI null is strongly dependent on the TR selected. For T1-FLAIR both the TR and TE values are kept relatively short to minimize T2-weighting. Considering these restrictions, the TI null for a T1-FLAIR sequence is typically in the range of 800-1000 ms. The graph below shows the approximate relationship between TI and TR for fluid/CSF suppression. Approximate TI required to null CSF signal depends on TR.

As described in the prior Q&A , nearly all the signals we record from solid organs using conventional MRI originate either from water or triglyceride protons. These H nuclei are relatively abundant and possess T2 relaxation times ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Ring of dark matter in galaxy cluster CL0024+17 But there is another pool of H nuclei, including water tightly bound to macromolecules, as well as protons along the backbone of larger proteins, solid fats, urate and hydroxyapatite crystals, enamel, cortical bone, collagen, and myelin, whose motions are highly restricted resulting in T2-values measured in micro seconds. Their signals decay so quickly that they are not recorded using standard MR techniques and can be considered \"MR invisible\". I commonly refer to them as \"dark protons\" or the \"dark pool\" . Our current failure to routinely visualize these dark protons implies we are missing out on a significant amount of potentially important information! Like dark matter in the universe, dark protons are ubiquitous and may constitute at least 20% of H nuclei potentially available for MR analysis in most solid organs. Those with super-short T2's (<0.1 ms) are currently not detectable with any clinical sequences, but can be measured indirectly through their interaction with other visible protons though dipolar and magnetization transfer mechanisms. Protons with slightly longer T2's (0.1 - 1.0 ms) can be rendered visible with a new class of ultrashort TE sequences (including UTE, PETRA, and ZTE), the subject of several later Q&As. Myelin (whose average T2 is about 0.3 ms) is an important component of this second category and which can now be visualized imaged using specialized UTE sequences (e.g. DESIRE, STAIR) that suppress unwanted signals from longer T2 components. An intermediately dark pool of protons, up to 40% by weight, are present in cartilaginous/fibrous tissues, such as ligaments, menisci, tendons, and periosteum. Their average T2 values lie in the 1-10 ms range, making them relatively \"invisible\" on long TE sequences, but detectable by short TE sequences achievable by most current clinical scanners. Because these tissues contain organized strands of collagen and/or elastin, both relaxation times and susceptibilities vary according to orientation in the main magnetic field, the so-called magic angle phenomenon which must be taken into account when imaging them.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/invisible-protons.html"}

Sir Joseph Larmor was an Irish-born mathematical physicist whose career spanned from the late 19th to the early 20th Century. For many years he served as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at St. John's College, Cambridge. His contemporaries included such notables as J.J. Thomson, Lord Kelvin, and James Clerk Maxwell. Sir Joseph Larmor (1857-1942) [Right] The first page of Larmor's famous 1897 paper from Philosophical Magazine. Larmor worked in an era when the basic structure of the atom was still being elucidated and quantum mechanics had yet to be developed. His famous equation of 1897 had nothing to do with NMR, as this phenomenon was still several decades away from being discovered. Instead it arose from attempts to explain the curious splitting of optical spectral lines by an external magnetic field described by Pieter Zeeman one year previously. Larmor's theory was that Zeeman's spectral lines were produced by charged particles (electrons) moving in elliptical orbits. Larmor demonstrated mathematically that these electrons should precess around the direction of the applied magnetic field. He further calculated that the frequency of precession was directly proportional to the strength of the applied field times a constant. Larmor's constant was directly related to the particle's charge/mass ratio. In later years as more became known about atomic structure, Larmor's equation was found to apply to any particle with spin or angular momentum, taking the form we recognize today: f o =  B o where f o is the precession frequency, B o is the strength of the externally applied field, and  is the gyromagnetic ratio , a constant specific to each specific nucleus or particle. The table (right) gives values of the gyromagnetic ratio (  ) for various nuclei and particles. Negative values for  mean that direction of precession is opposite to that of  H. Particles with  > 0 precess according to the left-hand rule (ie, in the same direction as one's curled fingers when left thumb points along Bo). Particles with  < 0 precess in opposite direction. We see from the table that among nuclei,  H has the highest gyromagnetic ratio. The resonance frequency of any particle at a certain field strength can easily be calculated using this table and the Larmor equation. For example, in a field ( B o ) of 1.5T, the resonance frequency of  H would be (42.58 MHz/T) x (1.5T) = 63.87 MHz. At 3.0T the resonance frequency would be twice as fast, or 127.74 MHz. By comparison, an the precession frequency of an electron in a field of 1.0T would be 27,204 MHz (or 27.204 GHz) and in a direction opposite to that of H. Thus to study electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) frequencies in the microwave region must be used.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/who-was-larmor.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Upper Airway Devices All conventional temporary oral and nasopharyngeal airway tubes are made entirely of plastic or silicone and are considered MR Safe . Two specialized nasal airway devices contain metal and are MR Conditional : The Breathe Implant  Wengen ( Kurz Medical ) is a small surgically implanted titanium plate sutured to the lateral nasal cartilages to increase the size of the nasal valve. These are extremely uncommon and primarily used in Europe. The Alaxo Nasal Stent, made of braided Nitinol (a non-ferromagnetic nickel-tin alloy), is inserted into the nasal vestibule and along the middle meatus to reduce nasal obstruction. Some high-performance athletes use the device. Self-applied by the patient, the stent may be worn for up to 18 hours a day. A longer version requiring placement by a physician extends into the nasopharynx and is used for treatment of sleep apnea. \"MR Safe\" nasopharyngeal and oral airways \"MR Conditional\" Alaxo Nasal Stent (Endo)tracheal Tubes \"Conventional\" endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are made almost entirely from plastic and can be considered safe for use in the MR environment. Those with inflatable cuffs, however, are technically classified as MR Conditional because they contain a tiny metal spring in the pilot balloon valve (where air for the cuff is injected). The valve should be taped down to the Y-connector of the ventilator circuit at least 3 cm away from any area of imaging interest (to avoid susceptibility artifact). The pilot valve springs of several newer tubes are non-ferromagnetic, reducing or eliminating such artifacts. Wire-reinforced cuffed endotracheal tube. \"Reinforced\" ETTs contain a metal coil (usually stainless steel) spirally wound in the wall of the tube to prevent kinking. Most manufacturers have declared their models to be MR Unsafe but some brands are rated as MR Conditional . If using such a conditional ETT, the airway should be fixed properly in place with adhesive tape, cloth tape or other appropriate means to prevent movement or dislodgement before entering the MR environment. Expect a large artifact over the neck and upper chest from the reinforcing wire. Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Extraglottic Airway Devices Extraglottic airway devices, more commonly known under their trade name, Laryngeal Mask Airways (LMAs) , are an alternative to tracheal intubation, especially in children undergoing MRI. They are inserted orally after induction of general anesthesia and fit tightly over the top of the larynx and pyriform fossae. MR safety issues mirror those of ETTs, depending on their composition. Most LMAs are all-plastic with just a pilot valve spring, so are (trivially) MR Conditional while some (uncommon) wire-reinforced models are rated MR Unsafe . Because LMAs are much larger than ETTs, they significantly distend the hypopharynx when in place. As such, radiologists should be aware that LMAs produce significant anatomic distortions in this region and can compress or displace mass lesions. \"MR Unsafe\" Jackson stainless steel tracheotomy tube with obturator Larynx/Laryngectomy Implants and Devices The MR safety of tracheostomy and laryngectomy tubes depends on their composition and design. Stainless steel tubes like that pictured right are, of course, contraindicated. All plastic tracheostomy tubes are MR Safe (unless they contain a spring-loaded pilot cuff valve, which should be taped away securely as with conventional cuffed ETTs). As with ETTs, the declared safety of wire-reinforced tracheotomy tubes is largely dependent on the risk-tolerance of the manufacturer. Some tubes are now reinforced with titanium rather than stainless steel resulting in considerably less susceptibility artifacts over the lower neck. Laryngectomy accessories (used by patients with permanent stomas) include short, uncuffed LaryTubes , base plates, buttons, studs, covers, and HME (Heat and Moisture Exchange) filters. Except for certain tracheostoma speech valves described below, essentially all wearable laryngectomy accessories are made of polyurethane or soft silicone and considered MR Safe . Voice prostheses are short tubes with flanges placed between the trachea and esophagus to allow speech in laryngectomy patients. The devices typically contain a one-way flap valve that prevents esophageal contents from entering the trachea. The patient speaks by exhaling while temporarily occluding the tracheal stoma, thus opening the prosthetic valve and allowing air to enter the pharynx and mouth for speech. Most voice prostheses are made entirely of plastic and are MR Safe . Others, like the Blom-Singer Advantage ( Inhealth Technologies ), contain a titanium valve and are MR Conditional . The Provox Activalve ( Atos Medical ) is unique in that it contains small magnets and is rated MR Unsafe by the manufacturer. The actual measured displacement forces at 1.5T are actually minimal, however, and would not likely cause dislodgment. Voice prosthesis contains valve that opens when stoma is occluded, allowing air to reach mouth for sound production \"MR Unsafe\" Provox Activalve (Atos Medical) voice prosthesis \"MR Unsafe\" ESKA Window II speech valve with magnets Instead of occluding the stoma with one's finger, a speech valve may be fitted over the stoma that spontaneously closes in response to forcible exhalation during attempted speech.

Others, including the Provox FreeHands FlexiVoice ( Atos Medical ) and the ESKA Window II ( Servona ) contain small magnets and are considered MR Unsafe . Laryngeal stents are used for short-term stabilization after laryngeal surgery or trauma and to prevent stenosis. To my knowledge all current models are made entirely of silicone and hence MR Safe . Laryngeal implants are used to bring paralyzed vocal cords into a more median position. Nearly all such implants are either injectable biomaterials or surgically implanted non-metals (hydroxyapatite, silicone) and are thus MR Safe .

{"id": "2b242788-58dd-4f2f-9ccf-0b26c1c4cb04", "contents": "Rotating Frame What is the rotating frame of reference? The rotating frame of reference is a concept used to simplify the complex motion of precessing spins before, during, or after RF-excitation. In slow motion it is not that hard to follow the magnetization ( M ) precessing around B o . In real time, however, the motion is a blur. Precession of magnetization (M) around Bo in slow motion. In real time, the precession at many MHz makes M appear as a blur. The reason M appears blurred in real time is that we are viewing the system from a stationary point of view, called the laboratory frame of reference . It's as though we are standing in the room pictured below trying to read the label of a record spinning on a turntable. (This old analogy made sense to those of us in grad school 30 years ago; perhaps it is less relatable to younger generations of scientists!) Laboratory frame of reference (x-y-z) versus rotating frame of reference (x'-y'-z'). Adapted from Fukushima and Roeder. As long as we remain in the laboratory ( x-y-z ) frame of reference, the motion of the letters on the record label remains a blur. However, if we were to \"jump\" onto the turntable and look down, the letters would now appear stationary and be easy to read. By \"jumping onto the turntable\" we have transformed our point of view into the rotating frame of reference . Mathematically this is equivalent to using a new coordinate system ( x '-y'-z') . If this is still a little confusing, perhaps a few more examples will help. First, we already live and work in a rotating frame system  the earth spinning on its axis! Viewed from outer space, the earth has a complex motion (rotation along its own axis and revolution around the sun). So, if we attempt to describe the motion of an object on earth using the perspective from outer space, it would be difficult to do. But since we are already riding on the spinning earth, the motion of objects on earth is considerably simplified. Another familiar example is watching versus riding on a merry-go-round: Merry-go-round viewed from the laboratory frame Merry-go-round viewed from the rotating frame A slightly different (but equivalent) way to think about the rotating frame is to view the system with a strobe light pulsing at the Larmor frequency. At each flash of the strobe, M will be lit up at exactly the same position along its course, making it appear stationary. Strobe OFF. M appears as a blur due to rapid motion. Strobe ON! The flash of the strobe synchronized with the Larmor frequency lights up M at exactly the same time each cycle, making it appear stationary. Why bother with the rotating frame? If we confine our discussion to the simple precession of M around B o there seems to be little advantage. However, when we start considering the effects of other magnetic fields (like B 1 ) or dynamic changes in phase or magnitude (such as with T1 or T2 relaxation), suddenly the motion of M becomes very complicated if viewed only from the laboratory frame of reference. In these cases we will find the rotating frame perspective essential for making the complex motion of M understandable. Using the rotating frame method, let us analyze what happens to M or individual spins when the B 1 field is applied at a frequency that exactly matches the Larmor precession. Application of B1 field rotating/oscillating at Larmor frequency viewed from the laboratory frame. This diagram shows the application of a rotating/oscillating B 1 field applied to the spin system. Viewed from the laboratory frame, both the B 1 field and spins are all rotating quickly. The B 1 arrow on the plane is shown in one position only for clarity but it is rotating just as fast as the spins and should also be a blur. Rotating frame at Larmor frequency. The image to the left is the system viewed in rotating frame where the frame rotation matches the Larmor frequency. That is, the frame is rotating exactly at the same rate as B 1 , the individual spins, and M .) This produces a strobe-like, \"stop action\" photo that allows us to clearly appreciate the direct effect B 1 has on M. Three very Interesting features about the system in the rotating frame should be noted: 1) The effect of the main field ( B o ) has disappeared . In the rotating frame the precession of M (and that of its component individual spins) around B o is no longer occurring. Everything is 'frozen' in place so it is as though B o no longer exists. This is represented in the diagram as a fading away of the green B o magnet pole. 2) The B 1 field is no longer rotating but appears static . B 1 is locked in a fixed relationship to the rotating frame. In the diagram we have arbitrarily placed B 1 along the x' -axis. By adjusting the phase of its transmission, however, we could have locked it along the y' -axis or any other direction in the transverse plane. 3) M has begun a new precession around B 1 . Since B o no longer exists in this frame of reference, the only magnetic field acting on M is the now stationary B 1 field. So M will precess around B 1 with frequency f 1 =  B 1 . Because B1 is typically only one-millionth the strength of B o , the precession of M around B 1 will be relatively slow (measured in Hz rather than MHz).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/rotating-frame.html"}

The first superconducting scanners in the 1980's had two cryogen chambers, an inner one containing liquid helium and an outer one containing liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen had to be topped off weekly and the helium monthly. In the 1990's helium-only systems were developed and by the early 2000's refrigeration systems had become so sophisticated and efficient that liquid helium needed to be added only every 2-3 years. Over the last decade zero boil off ( ZBO ) refrigeration systems have become standard, allowing essentially unlimited normal operation without need for helium refill. However, the cold head and refrigeration compressors still need regular filter changes and other servicing, so some cryogen replacement at these times is unavoidable. The most recent developments in commercially available MR magnet designs are sealed systems which require no refilling or venting. You can expect the next generation of superconducting MR scanners to contain no cryogens at all. This is largely due to the development of efficient pulse tube and 2-stage Gifford-McMahon (G-M) cryocoolers that are able to maintain temperatures below the 9.4K required for NbTi superconductivity without liquid helium. Currently, the 0.5T superconducting Paramed OpenMRI is cryogen-free using a G-M system (the wire used is MgB 2 that becomes superconductive below 39K).

The trade-off for increased speed is decreased spatial resolution, as can be appreciated from the somewhat blurry real-time image below. Current commercially available real-time cardiac MRI sequences are based on modifications of traditional parallel imaging techniques (T-SENSE and T-GRAPPA). In these methods the (auto)calibration data is acquired continuously from several contiguous cardiac frames. Read conjugate symmetry and strong gradients permit echo times of less than 1 ms.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding In general the vast majority of dental devices and implants can be considered \"MR Safe\" or MR Conditional , although relatively few have undergone rigorous testing of displacement, torque, and heating effects as specified by the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) to earn these official labels. Other than a few relatively isolated instances described below, I am aware of no significant patient injuries due to scanning of any type of dental implant. Some authorities have recommended careful inspection of the non-removable, fixed dental devices prior to MRI to insure that the components are loose or dislodged, but we seldom do this in practice unless the patient reports that the device is loose. Some metal-containing orthodontic devices (such as brace archwires, palate expanders, and functional fixed appliances) will undergo RF-heating, though at levels far below the 8 C 10C heat pain threshold for oral mucosa or injury to the highly heat-sensitive periodontal ligament. They may also experience some deflection or torque in the static field that may exceed their weight, but this should not be of concern if they are securely anchored. In the absence of specific manufacturers' recommendations or published testing, it is wise to consider most metallic implants to be at least MR Conditional with patients given instructions to be attuned to the possibility of implant heating or a pulling sensation on the devices during the scan. Performing MRI in \"Normal Operating Mode\" and avoiding high SAR sequences wherever possible should be considered. Devices Without Magnets Conventional Dentures . Conventional dentures are typically made of composite resin, acrylic, or porcelain without any metal components. ( Magnetic dentures are discussed below). Conventional dentures are fully safe to scan and do not need to be removed prior to MRI. If conscious sedation is to be used during the scan, however, we recommend that dentures and other easily removable oral appliances such as retainers be taken out to reduce chances of airway obstruction. Fillings . Materials commonly used to fill dental caries include amalgam (primarily mercury/sliver, plus tin and copper), gold, porcelain, composite resins, and glass ionomer. As these substances are either diamagnetic or weakly paramagnetic, no MR safety concerns exist. (Note: A number of countries, but not the US, have banned the use of some dental amalgams because of slow mercury release. MRI exposure, especially at 7T, appears to temporarily accelerate this process). Crowns and Bridges . Most d ental crowns and bridges are made of resin, ceramic, or porcelain and are non-magnetic. A moderate number of metal or porcelain-on-metal devices also exist, most commonly composed of gold, palladium, nickel or chromium. The latter two metals are ferromagnetic, and will create a moderate local susceptibility artifact on MRI. In general we have no medical concerns in scanning a patient with metal crowns or bridges and take no special precautions. That said, one case report describes a loose metal crown being pulled off a tooth during MRI. A second case report describes the premature termination of an MR scan due to pain from apparent magnetic traction on a metal crown. Braces . Traditional metal braces are consist of brackets (cemented to each tooth) and connected by arch wires. Brackets are usually made of stainless steel, while arch wires may be stainless steel, titanium, molybdinum, or nickel-containing alloys. Standard metal braces pose no safety issues, but the multiple ferromagnetic brackets often create huge susceptibility artifacts that distort images of the face and brain. On rare occasions where MRI of these areas is essential, we have asked the patient to have the braces removed before repeat imaging. Marked susceptibility artifact due to braces Devices Containing Magnets A small number of dental, orthodontic, and maxillofacial implants contain permanent magnets. These present several additional problems compared to simple metal-containing implants. More artifacts . The small magnets create extremely large susceptibility artifacts, potentially obscuring not only the face but much of the head. Increased forces . Translational and rotational forces on the magnets are equal or greater to those from ferromagnetic metals, creating a movement risk if they are not securely attached to bone. Magnet damage . The magnets themselves (even those made of high coercivity Sm-Co ceramics) may undergo demagnetization or magnetization reversal in fields of 1.5T or higher, particularly when angled with respect to B o . In evaluating a magnet-containing device with regard to MR safety and screening, it is critical to know exactly where the magnets are located. The case of magnetic dentures provides a good example of why this is important. Magnetic dentures Magnetic Dentures . Also known as \"implant overdentures\", these devices are becoming increasingly popular because of their firm fit and ease of insertion and removal. The removable acrylic/ porcelain denture component has 2-4 flat permanent magnets embedded along its periphery. These match up with an equivalent set of titanium posts surgically placed in the mandible or maxilla. To the top of each post is affixed either: 1) a second small magnet with opposite polarity to its mate on the denture, or 2) with a non-magnetized but ferromagnetic abutment or \"keeper\". In both systems, the magnets in the denture base lock into place as they are attracted to their respective abutments or sister magnets. The difference between these two systems is important  in one case taking out the denture removes all the magnets from the body, while in the other case it does not. It should be noted that often the retained magnetic components can be easily unscrewed by the dentist from its post or baseplate, thus allowing MRI to be safely performed. Other Magnetic Oral and Facial Devices . Like the case of magnetic dentures, MR safety decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the implant, the location of the magnets, and the manufacturer's recommendations. The latter is primarily based upon whether the manufacturer believes the magnets from their system will be damaged by exposure to the static MRI field. Specific examples of MR-incompatible devices based on risk of magnet dysfunction include the StecoTitanmagnetic X-,Y-, and Z-line abutments, magnetic root extrusion system, magnetic root caps, and coupled obturators ( S teco-system-technik GmbH , Germany); the Sydney MagnoGlide orthodontic appliance ( Macono , Australia); the Dyna implant system ( Dyna Dental BV , Netherlands); and the MED osteostimulator ( Magdent , Israel). Although most nasal septal button closure devices are made of plastic, one MR Unsafe model is the Blom-Singer Nasal Septal Perforation Prosthesis ( InHealth Technologies , USA) that uses paired, silicone-coated neodymium magnets. As always, please consult the manufacturer directly before making a decision about the suitability of any device for MRI.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dentalfacial-implants.html"}

Conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is typically performed using a single-shot echo-planar (ss-EPI) sequence. This has the advantage of speed but suffers from susceptibility artifacts/distortions, low signal-to-noise, and spatial blurring. To improve image quality (at the expense of increased imaging time) readout-segmented echo-planar diffusion methods (rs-DWI) have been developed. Siemens currently markets one such sequence under the trade name RESOLVE (REadout Segmentation Of Long Variable Echo trains) . In rs-DWI k -space sampling occurs in a small number (3-6) of \"shots\". Each shot has limited transversal of k -space in the readout direction, but full resolution along the phase-encode axis. Because motion artifacts between segments can create substantial artifacts, 2D navigator readout segments are acquired during the second and subsequent echoes. At k -space center, the navigator is repeatedly acquired to account for shot-dependent nonlinear phase differences that arise from non-rigid motion of the head or other imaged body part. As shown in the example below, improved signal-to-noise, spatial resolution, and decreased susceptibility artifacts are noted using this strategy K -space sampling strategy for readout-segmented DWI Comparison of single-shot echo-planar DWI with multi-shot DWI. Note decreased susceptibility distortion at the skull base on multi-shot image. Better signal-to-noise and spatial resolution is also observed on the multi-shot image, a result of longer imaging time. PROPELLER/BLADE diffusion methods may also be used to reduce susceptibility artifacts and improve spatial resolution compared to ss-EPI methods. These employ fast (turbo) spin echoes and sample k -space in a radial fashion. Image quality is significantly improved and motion artifacts reduced. These sequences may be superior to rs-DWI-EPI methods where susceptibility artifacts are most problematic, such as in evaluating temporal bone cholesteatomas. Notwithstanding these advantages, image acquisition time may be comparatively longer compared to rs-DWI and imaging artifacts may limit acquisition to primarily the axial plane. Additionally, the use of turbo spin echoes increases specific absorption rate (SAR) and produces more tissue heating compared to gradient echo EPI methods.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/readout-segmented-dwi.html"}

A few elemental solids and alloys, especially those containing iron, nickel, and cobalt, exhibit extremely large positive susceptibilities and are termed ferromagnetic . Whereas paramagnetism and diamagnetism are properties of individual atoms or molecules, ferromagnetism is a property of a group of atoms or molecules in a solid crystal or lattice. All ferromagnetic substances have unpaired electron spins that are strongly entwined by a quantum mechanical force, exchange interaction . Large groups of atoms in a ferromagnetic substance form magnetic domains in which arrays of electron spins become locked together in alignment. Exchange interaction, also called exchange coupling, is a quantum mechanical phenomenon arising from the balancing of kinetic energies and repulsive forces among outer shell electrons in various spin orientations. Because it is primarily electrostatic (rather than magnetic in nature), the exchange interaction is localized to just a few neighboring atoms. The formation of magnetic domains accounts for the extremely large values of  observed in ferromagnetic materials. It also gives them a \"magnetic memory,\" or remanence , in which the actual value of  depends on the past magnetization history of the material. Iron, for example, can retain appreciable residual magnetization even after the external magnetic field has been removed. This magnetic memory is one reason iron and iron alloys are frequently chosen for making permanent magnets. Magnetic domains are small, randomly oriented and spontaneously magnetized regions in a ferromagnetic material whose spins are locked into orderly arrays. Application of small external fields moves the walls between them to form larger domains. Higher external fields reorient the domains to face the same direction and increase net magnetization. Video under Kerr microscope shows how a single domain in steel changes its magnetic orientation as the external field is increased. When fully dark in final image, it is completely aligned with the external field. (Click image for animation) Single domain particle caught half way in transformation. Direction of external field is from top to bottom of image. White color in domain reflects magnetization opposing field; dark color reflects magnetization aligned with the external magnetic field. Permanent MR magnets are purposely made of ferromagnetic materials, usually alloys of rare earth alloys and iron, such as neodymium-iron-boron (Nd-Fe-B).

In 1946 Felix Bloch published a mathematical analysis of the \"Nuclear Induction\" phenomenon including a set of equations explaining the origin and properties of the NMR signal. This paper is very readable and does not require a high level of mathematics or physics background. Bloch began with the assumption that the millions of individual nuclei in a sample could be represented by a single vector M. (Bloch called M the \"polarization\" but today it is more frequently known as the net magnetization . ) Just as individual nuclei possess spin angular momentum, so does the vector M . As Joseph Larmor showed a half century before, an external field ( B ) produces a torque (  ) or \"twisting force\" on M resulting in its precession at angular frequency  =  B . Since M is a vector rotating in space it can be resolved into have three components  M x (t), M y (t) , and M z (t)  each a function of time. M x (t) and M y (t) are the transverse components ; M z (t) is the longitudinal component . A torque or twisting force (  ) results from the interaction of net magnetic angular momentum ( M ) and the magnetic field ( M ), defined as the vector cross product  = M x B . The direction of  is perpendicular to both M and B according to the right-hand rule. This torque causes M to precess around B as shown. For the case of simple precession of M in a cone around B , the longitudinal component is a constant, M z (t) = C . The transverse components rotate sinusoidally around the z -direction at angular frequency . For simplicity we can adjust their phases so M x (t) = 0 at t = 0 , allowing us to write M x (t) = A sin t and M y (t) = A cos t, where A is a scaling factor. Nuclear induction signal recorded by Bloch et al (1946). As the magnetic field was increased (from left to right on the oscilloscope tracing), a transient induction voltage peak was detected in the receiver coil as the system swept through resonance. The \"nuclear induction signal\" recorded by Bloch et al in their famous experiment reflected the generation of a small current in their receiver coil from the precession of M around B . Like Purcell's group, Bloch et al carried out a continuous wave (CW) NMR experiment where the RF transmit field ( B 1 ) was kept constant as the magnetic field was varied and the system swept through resonance. Bloch and colleagues recognized that the NMR nuclear induction signal they had recorded was a transient phenomenon. They even made estimates on how quickly this signal died out as a function of type of material studied (water vs paraffin vs a paramagnetic solution) and the rate of change of the applied magnetic field. Bloch reasoned that NMR signal decay occurrs because the individual spins that comprise M interact with each other and their environment. As such, M would not precess indefinitely around B , but would instead seek to return to its initial alignment parallel to B with equilibrium magnitude M o . To do this, the spin system had to release its energy to the environment, a process Bloch termed relaxation . Bloch introduced two relaxation time constants , which he called T1 and T2 , to account for the reestablishment of thermal equilibrium of the nuclear magnetization after generation of the NMR signal. T1 reflected the regrowth of longitudinal magnetization ( M z ), whereas T2 characterized the decay of the transverse components ( M x and M y ). Bloch assumed that T1 and T2 relaxation followed first-order kinetics, such as that seen with the decay of a radioisotope. Furthermore, he assumed that single (rather than multiple) time constants were sufficient to describe this process. T1 and T2 were defined phenomenologically and were not derived from fundamental principles. Although Bloch did not specify the physical mechanisms giving rise to T1 and T2, he did correctly conclude that T1 must result from thermal agitation and T2 from internuclear actions. (The true atomic and molecular origins of T1 and T2 relaxation are considered in much greater detail in multiple subsequent Q&A's). Bloch then modified his original vector equation to account for T1 and T2 effects. Specifically, during return to equilibrium, the equations of motion for M in simplified form after a 90-pulse become M x (t) = M o e t/T2 sin t M y (t) = M o e t/T2 cos t M z (t) = M o (1  e t/T1 ) These equations predict that M will exhibit a spiraling precession around B at the Larmor frequency with decay of transverse components back to zero and regrowth of the longitudinal component to its original maximum value M o . Because T2 is always shorter than T1, the transverse components typically decay completely before the longitudinal magnetization is fully restored. The spiral pattern is sometimes said to resemble a \"tent\". The longitudinal relaxation time, T1 , therefore represents the time required for M z to grow from 0 to (1  1/e), or about 63% of its final value. Similarly, the transverse relaxation time, T2 , represents the time required for M x or M y to decay down to 1/e (about 37%) of their initial maximum values.

Field plots (similar to the illustration right) are available from each magnet manufacturer. For cylindrical superconducting scanners, the fringe fields are largest along the direction of the axis bore (along the z -axis or B o direction).

These lights are called magneto-phosphenes and are believed to arise from direct stimulation the retina by magnetic-field induced currents. The flickers may appear as stripes, curves, waves, or rings, typically in the peripheral visual fields. They are usually white but are sometimes reported to have a bluish or yellowish tint. They occur in less than 1% of patients at 1.5 T and 3.0 T, but as high as 20% in patients at 7.0 T. Fortunately, magnetophosphenes are thought to be harmless. Magnetophosphene patterns observed by healthy young volunteers by Seidel et al (1968) Unlike peripheral nerve stimulation, magnetophosphenes are generated by electric fields of very low frequency (10-50 Hz) and magnitude (50-100 mV/meter). The high sensitivity of the retina to electromagnetic fields is thought to result from its structure and function, in which single light photons must be detected and where the final output of each retinal ganglion cell represents the integrated responses of over 100 individual photoreceptor cells. Although rarely induced by gradients, magnetophosphenes are generally considered the be the result of physical movement of a person's head within the static magnetic field.

The relative high signal of arterial blood on balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequences can be further accentuated by exploiting inflow-related enhancement similar to that used in time-of-flight MRA. Major vendors offer such sequences under a variety of trade names. Siemens calls theirs NATIVE TrueFISP (\"Non-contrast MRA of ArTerIes and VEins using Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution and True Fast Imaging with Steady-state Precession.\") GE's version is called Inhance Inflow IR (IFIR) , while Philips uses B-TRANCE (\"Balanced TRiggered Angiography Non-Contrast Enhanced). Hitachi calls their method VASC-ASL (\"Veins and Arteries Sans Contrast - Arterial Spin Labeling\") and Cannon Time-SLIP (\"Time Spatial Labeling Inversion Pulse)\" . A simple workflow example illustrating the technique for renal MRA is shown below. The area of interest is first saturated with one or more 180-RF pulses. These saturation pulses invert signal from background tissue as well as venous blood. \"Fresh\" (unsaturated/fully magnetized) arterial blood next flows into the slab. After an appropriate inversion time ( TI ) that nulls signal from background tissue, MRA signal generation is initiated using a rapid 3D b-SSFP sequence. For imaging the upper abdomen or chest, cardiac gating with respiratory triggering or navigator echoes is commonly employed to reduce motion artifacts. An optional chemical shift selective fat suppression pulse (e.g. SPIR) is also frequently applied immediately before readout. Alternatively, water excitation or a Dixon method may be used. Inflow-enhanced b-SSFP using two inversion slabs at 1200 and 400 msec The usual imaging parameters at 1.5T have TI's in the 1000-1300 msec range. Obviously a single TI choice cannot null all tissues, but this is a compromise value that suppresses muscle and venous blood while allowing adequate time for fresh arterial blood inflow from outside the slab. For patients in cardiac failure or very slow vascular inflow due to stenoses, sometimes the TI value must be extended over more than one cardiac cycle to the range of 2000 or more. In some cases additional obliquely oriented saturation bands may be placed over the kidneys as well. To further suppress signal from the inferior vena cava, a third inversion band is sometimes applied inferior to the larger first (blue) band at an intermediate TI value (e.g., 400-800 msec). Many variations are possible. The typical balanced-SSFP sequence is performed in 3D mode, using short TR/TE values and high flip angles (e.g., TR / TE /  = 7/3/80). A rectangular field-of-view is often used with phase oversampling to prevent wrap-around artifacts. Examples are shown below. IR-Prepped b-SSFP of renal arteries (maximum intensity projection).

Selective Water Excitation (WE) is different than Fat-Sat, although they are both based around the use of chemically selective RF-pulses. In Fat-Sat, fat protons are selectively excited and then dephased with a spoiler gradient. In WE, fat protons are left alone and water protons are selectively stimulated for image generation. No spoilers are used. The two methods are compared below. Water excitation image of the shoulder. Pulse design is more difficult with WE than Fat-Sat because strict control over phase dispersion is required. Although phase-controlled single RF-pulses can be used, a more common technique is to employ a cluster of RF-pulses in close succession. For example, instead of using a single, frequency-specific 90 - RF-pulse, two appropriately timed broadband, non-selective 45  -pulses can result in selective excitation of the water signal only: At equilibrium, the magnetization vectors of water and fat both point along the z -axis in the direction of the main magnetic field ( B o ). The first 45  -pulses causes both vectors be tipped partially toward the transverse plane and begin to precess. Because fat and water protons precess at different frequencies after a few msec the fat and water vectors will be exactly 180  out of phase. At this time a second non-selective 45  -pulse will rotate the fat vector back to its original position along the z -axis while rotating the water vector entirely into the transverse plane. The combination of the two non-selective 45  -pulses thus had the same effect as a single frequency-selective 90  -water excitation pulse! I will not provide the diagram, but will assure you that selective fat excitation can be accomplished by a similar method but using a 45  /45  pulse pair. (The orange fat vector just flips leftward into the xy -plane at the last step and the blue water vector points upward). I suggest you create this drawing as a homework assignment. The 45-45 pulse pair described above is the simplest in a class of composite pulses known as binomial pulses . Binomial pulses have flip angles that follow the pattern of coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a+b) n : 1-1, 1-2-1, 1-3-3-1, etc. Thus, a 90-pulse could be constructed as a [45-45] pair, a [22.5-45-22.5] triplet, or a [11.25-33.75-33.75-11.25] quadruplet. Any combination whose ratios follow the binomial pattern and add up to 90 will work to selectively excite water and leave the fat resonance unchanged. The longer the binomial chain of pulses, the more precise is the excitation band of frequencies. Most imaging implementations use a 1-2-1 triplet. For spectroscopy applications chains of length 5-10 would not be uncommon. A triplet or higher binomial chain takes a little longer than a single Fat-Sat pulse, but since no spoiler gradients or inversion time wait periods are required, image acquisition can begin immediately after the WE module is completed. Thus imaging time is only slightly prolonged and the number of slices available for a given TR is only slightly compromised. WE pulses are less sensitive than most other techniques to non-uniformities in B 1 transmission, including variations in flip angle. The nulling of fat is primarily controlled by precise timing of the interpulse delays that allow water and fat to go out of phase. Even if the flip angles are not perfect, the total flip angle for the fat spins will still be 0 even though water may not be exactly at 90. The major MR vendors all offer some version of water excitation under various acronyms, with some technical differences and variable limitations. Siemens and Hitachi use the generic names \"Water Excitation\" or WE; GE calls their method SSRF (Spectral-Spatial RF) ; Philips uses ProSET ( Pr inciple o f S elective E xcitation T echnique) ; Canon calls theirs WET ( W ater E xcitation T echnique) .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/water-excitation.html"}

The conductor used in nearly all modern superconducting MR scanners is niobium-titanium (NbTi) that becomes superconductive below 9.4K. Each wire is composed of multiple NbTi microfilaments embedded in a copper core. The copper core has two functions: 1) to support and protect the delicate microfilaments; and 2) to serve as a low resistance path for large currents in the event superconductivity is lost. Scanners and spectrometers with field strengths greater than 10T frequently use a niobium-tin (Nb 3 Sn) alloy. Magnesium diboride (MgB 2 ) is also emerging as a new superconducting material for scanners and other magnetic instruments because of its much higher transition temperature ( 39K). Cross section of winding from a superconductive magnet with NbTi multifiliments embedded in a Cu core First layer of NbTiCu solenoidal winding being applied to a glass reinforced polymer former (shell). Superconducting magnet with aluminum former. The windings here have been broken up into 8 sections. This improves homogeneity and minimizes fringe fields. The wires are wound onto either a glass-reinforced polymer or aluminum former (cylinder) in layers separated by epoxy and dividers. Rather than using a single continuous main field winding, homogeneity is improved by breaking up the main coil into 6-10 separate windings with gaps. The main magnet windings are bathed in liquid helium (4K) in a structure called a cryostat . The cryostat is a multi-compartmental structure that functions like a Thermos bottle. It contains not only the main magnet windings and channels for liquid helium, but also various insulating and vacuum layers to thermally shield the coils from the warm external environment. The cryostat also typically contains superconducting shim coils (to improve homogeneity) and active shielding coils (to minimize stray/fringe fields). The external casing of the cryostat as well as the helium vessel inner and outer shells are typically made of non-magnetic stainless steel. The walls of the vacuum chambers are constructed of either nonmagnetic stainless steel or glass-reinforced polymer. The cold shields are typically 3-10 mm thick and made from a low emissivity/high thermal conductivity material such as aluminum. Representative cross-section of a typical superconducting magnet (designs vary). LIquid helium chambers are colored aqua. Active shielding coils (not pictured) are near the shim coils at the two scanner ends. Because of global helium shortages and increased expense, vendors have developed new scanner designs that use only a small amount (~ 10 L) of liquid helium that is sealed into the scanner during manufacturing and never needs to be refilled. The magnet coils sit in a vacuum rather than within a liquid helium bath. They are in contact with cooling tubes that circulate liquid helium from their small storage compartments. During unexpected loss of superconductivity, no gaseous helium can escape. Thus these systems do not require a quench tube making them easier to site.

Surprisingly, no energy is required to keep the precession of an individual proton going. The reason for this is not immediately obvious but can be understood by considering the energetics of a precessing gyroscope. The gyroscope pictured above is precessing in a circle parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the earth's gravitational field. Although precessing, the center of mass of the gyroscope remains unchanged in height from the floor. The gyroscope's potential energy is directly proportional to the height of its center of gravity. Since this height remains constant during the precession, no change in energy occurs. A similar explanation can be used to demonstrate that a magnet (AKA nuclear spin) does not undergo energy exchange during simple precession. The diagram to the left shows a small magnet (here, a compass needle) aligned with, against, or at an angle to the external magnetic field ( B o ). The lowest energy state of the system is when the needle is aligned with B o . To twist the needle in the opposite direction requires the input of energy (like pushing it with your finger). The opposed state thus has a higher energy level than the aligned state. During precession, the angle of orientation of the needle with respect to the external field does not change. Hence energy is neither gained nor lost. The B o field serves to sustain the precession, but does not create the precession nor contribute energy to maintain it.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/energy-for-precession.html"}

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, the Fourier transform-based spin-warp imaging technique of Edelstein and colleagues has been the dominant method for spatial encoding the MR signal. If you think about \"regular MRI\" as acquiring data using successive application of phase- and frequency-encoding gradients, you are thinking about some variant of the spin-warp method. A prototype conventional 2D spin-echo pulse sequence using spin-warp imaging is illustrated above. Here an MR signal is generated after each pair of 90-180 degree RF-pulses. Slice-select gradients are turned on simultaneously with each RF-pulse so that only a single slice is stimulated. Frequency-encoding is performed using a dephase lobe between the 90- and 180-pulses and a readout lobe after the 180-pulse. The dephase lobe imparts a frequency-dependent phase shift to protons along this axis as a function of their spatial position within the gradient. The phases of these spins are inverted by the 180-pulse then rephased into an echo by the readout lobe. The digitized values of the MR signal at each time point are then inserted into a single horizontal row of the k-space matrix, filling it from left-to-right. The unique feature of the spin-warp sequence is that a variable-amplitude phase-encoding gradient is applied during signal evolution, typically between the 90- and 180-pulses. Additional MR signals are collected for this slice during the next TR interval with the same frequency-encoding gradient but with a different phase-encoding gradient. The phase-encode gradient provides a method for differentiating signals according to spatial location along this direction. With each successive application of the phase-encode gradient, the digitized MR signal is used to fill another row of k -space. For routine MR imaging, this process is typically repeated on the order 256 times. Once all the rows have been filled with data, Fourier transform methods can be used to reconstruct the image. If you've made it this far through the k -space Q&A's I suggest you carve out a quarter hour of time to watch the two videos below by the late Sir Paul Callaghan.

The cells of k -space are commonly displayed on rectangular grid with principal axes k x and k y . The k x and k y axes of k -space correspond to the horizontal ( x -) and vertical ( y -) axes of the image. The k -axes, however, represent spatial frequencies in the x - and y -directions rather than positions.

In other words, small objects (like the small white circle right) have ripples far out into the periphery of k -space, while larger objects have their spectral energies more concentrated at the center.

For many years DW imaging of the body under free breathing conditions was considered impossible because it was thought that cardiac and respiratory motion would lead to irretrievable loss of diffusion-weighted information. In 2004 Takahara et al. overcame these limitations, developing a technique they named diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) , an acronym still used by Philips for their product sequence. Equivalent whole-body DW sequences are now available from other vendors: GE ( enhanced(e)DWI ), Siemens ( REVEAL ), Hitachi ( body DWI ), and Canon ( Body Vision ). The conceptual break-through that made whole-body DWI feasible was the recognition that even though organs of the abdomen and chest move during image acquisition, they do so \"coherently\". Their physical displacements are cyclic and while this motion produces some spatial blurring it does not significantly affect the magnitude of the DW signal. As currently implemented, whole-body is more reliably performed at 1.5T because of increased susceptibility artifacts at 3.0T. Moderately strong diffusion-sensitizing gradients are used (b-values on the order of 1000 s/mm ), preceded by a plus an inversion pulse (SPAIR or STIR) for fat suppression. Blocks of approximately 40-50 axial images 4-5-mm-thick are acquired using parallel imaging and echo-planar readout, with imaging times in the range of 6-7 min per station. Depending on patient size a \"whole-body\" DWI survey from the neck through the pelvis can be acquired in 45 minutes or less. A true whole body scan from head to toe may require 6-7 blocks and take somewhat longer. The blocks are digitally stitched together and typically displayed in an inverted mode that resembles PET-CT. Lymphoma, prostate cancer, and small cell carcinoma have been the most widely studied. Because of artifacts, conventional MR images must still be obtained for confirmation of certain DWI lesions.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding A port is a device for vascular access typically implanted in the upper chest. It consists of two parts: a subcutaneous reservoir made of plastic, titanium, or stainless steel enclosing a self-sealing silicone bubble for needle insertion; and a catheter connected to the reservoir whose tip is placed fluroscopically into the superior vena cava or other major thoracic vein. At least a dozen companies produce these devices, the largest being AngioDynamics, Braun Medical, Bard, Cook Medical, MedComp, Navilyst Medical, and Smiths Medical. Common b rand names include Port-a-Cath, Clip-a-Port, Infuse-a-Port, Medi-Port, and PowerPort. Vascular access port with tip in superior vena cava To my knowledge, none of these commercially available portal systems is rated MR Unsafe . Those with metal reservoirs are by definition MR Conditional (with relatively minor restrictions for imaging at 3T or less). Patients with metal-containing ports should be warned that they may feel a pulling or tugging sensation when placed in the scanner. However, because these devices are firmly sutured in place between the skin and chest wall there is little chance of dangerous movement or dislodgment. Nearly all other non-port vascular access catheters and devices do not contain metal and are MR Safe .

The device is simply a short metal needle whose tip is placed in the marrow cavity of the tibia or other bone for infusion when peripheral vascular sites are unavailable. As their placement can be very tenuous (especially in children) and only slight movement can make them nonfunctional, their use in MRI is contraindicated. That said, in adults IO needles are literally screwed into the dense cortical bone and are usually solidly seated, making it unlikely they would be dislodged in a magnetic field. So I would personally be less concerned about the use in MRI if firmly implanted in older children or adults (but might wrap the site as a precaution).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/portsvascular-access.html"}

The gradient shields are slightly larger in diameter than the primary gradient coils and generate a counter magnetic field to reduce eddy currents induced in the magnet structure. The most effective way to control eddy currents is to prevent them from being generated in the first place. This was the motivation for developing actively-shielded (AKA self-shielded) gradients. In this configuration, shield coils are placed around the gradient coils used for imaging. These shield coils cancel/minimize the distant magnetic effects of the imaging gradients, reducing eddy currents induced shims, cryostat, main coils, and magnet housing. Today, nearly all MR scanners employ this technique which reduces eddy currents by a order of magnitude. As shown in the above diagram, the x -, y - and z - imaging gradient coils are mounted concentrically in the standard fashion. Just beyond the imaging gradients are three corresponding active shield coils. These have a topology in parallel with their associated imaging coils but are located at larger radii. The currents in these shields run in a direction opposite to those in the imaging gradient coils and are configured to minimize the magnetic flux that extends outside of the shields. Both the coils and shields are resistive and are driven by high voltage currents. Water cooling jackets, tubes, or channels typically are placed between the imaging and shielding coils to remove the appreciable heat generated from both.

No. The risk of NSF varies according to the type of contrast agent used, divided into 3 groups by the American College of Radiology (ACR). Group I agents are historically associated with the highest risk of NSF. The vast majority of NSF cases have been reported with Omniscan  (gadodiamide), while the second highest number have been reported with Magnevist (gadopentetate). Optimark (gadoversetamide) holds the non-enviable third position, a surprising result due to its relatively low market penetrance and use. These agents, all with a linear structure, have been banned for sale in most of Europe, and are prohibited from being advertised in the United States. The high prevalence of NSF cases associated with Ominscan and Optimark is likely related to the fact that these drugs have relatively weak binding of gadolinium to the chelate. This is reflected in the values of their thermodynamic stability constants, shown in the table right. In that our current concepts of NSF pathophysiology relate to deposition of free Gd in tissues, it makes sense that contrast agents more likely to dissociate would carry a higher risk of the disease. The relatively high numbers of NSF cases associated with Magnevist is probably not explainable by weak ligand binding, since its dissociation constant is five orders of magnitude higher than Ominscan and Optimark. One explanation is that Magnevist may be overrepresented in the total number of reported NSF cases simply because of its dominant market share and high worldwide use. Cases of NSF have have rarely been reported with Group II agents, and nearly all of these are considered \"confounded\"  meaning that these patients received two or more different gadolinium compounds and hence causation by a single agent could not be established. However, (non-confounded) single agent cases of NSF have been reported for Gadavist , MultiHance , Dotarem, and ProHance. To my knowledge no cases of NSF have been reported with the relatively new gadolinium agent, Eovist  (gadoxetate) or the very new Vueway /Elucerim (gadopiclenol) . Because of limited data and worldwide experience, these agents were initially placed by the ACR in a separate category (Group III), although gadopiclenol was moved to Group II in 2023. Eovist  has been around long enough that it could be justifiably moved up to Group II in my opinion. (This is the recommendation of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, but not the ACR). Notwithstanding the ACR Classification model, US Food and Drug Administration requires the following black box warning to be included in product literature for all gadolinium-based contrast agents: In conclusion, even though some contrast agents have not been directly implicated in the development of NSF, no gadolinium-based contrast formulation should be considered completely free of risk .

Whereas a spin echo (SE) arises from the action of two RF pulses, a stimulated echo (STE) occurs from the action of three or more RF pulses. In the diagram (right) three RF pulses have miraculously produced five echoes! But from where did all these echoes arise? A train of three radiofrequency pulses (1,2,3) creates three primary spin echoes (A,B,C), one secondary spin echo (D), and one stimulated echo (E). By inspecting the timing of each echo, we see that echoes A, B, and C are primary \"conventional\" spin (Hahn) echoes produced by each possible pair of RF-pulses. Specifically, echo A results from pulses 1&2, echo B results from pulses 2&3, and echo C results from pulses 1&3. Echo D is called a secondary spin echo and results from the spins in echo A being acted upon by RF-pulse #3 by the following mechanism: i) At the center peak of echo A spins in the transverse plane have once again been brought into phase. ii) Between the center of echo A and RF-pulse #3, these spins again dephase by T2* effects. iii) RF-pulse #3 flips over some of these spins allowing them to rephase and eventually refocus into Echo D. iv) Note that RF-pulse #3 is located exactly midway between Echoes A and D. Echo E is the stimulated echo (STE) . A spin-phase diagram similar to that in the last Q&A for the Hahn echo is used. We once again consider four spins ( a,b , c,d ) that have dephased after the initial 90-pulse. Spins a and c are in local fields lower than B o , are precessing slightly slower than the Larmor frequency, and are losing phase. Spins b and d are in local fields higher than B o , precessing faster, and gaining phase. Moreover, we have picked the spin pairs ( a-b ) and ( c-d ) to have local field offsets of the same magnitude but opposite polarities, so they gain or lose phase relative to their partner at the same relative rates. The second 90-pulse tips the dephased spins into the vertical ( xz- ) plane. For understanding the STE we only need consider the z-components of the the spins at this step. The z-components do not precess but remain aligned (\"locked\") around the B o direction. However, T1 relaxation occurs with a resulting net growth in components along the +z-axis. This feature allows STE's to have T1-weighting. The third 90-pulse flips the z -components back into the transverse ( xy -) plane where precession occurs. Now each spin in a pair can catch up with its partner, rephasing along the  y -axis and creating the STE. Just like the Hahn echo not all the components come into phase at exactly the same time. So the STE is of lower amplitude and spread out more widely in time. Formation of a stimulated echo by three 90-pulses.

Because of its paramagnetic properties, gadolinium facilitates both longitudinal and transverse magnetic relaxation, thereby shortening both T1 and T2 of tissues in which it accumulates. The dominant effect (T1 vs T2 shortening), however, depends on baseline tissue relaxation times in the absence of the agent, as well as the maximum tissue concentration achieved. In relaxation chemistry it is often more convenient to talk about relaxation rates rather than relaxation times . Relaxation rates, measured in sec 1 , are simply the inverses of the relaxation times. Total relaxation rates of chemical processes are often the sum of relaxation rates of various component steps. Accordingly, the relaxation rates observed after contrast administration, 1/T1 obs and 1/T2 obs , can be calculated as the sum of relaxation rates contributed by the native tissue and the paramagnetic contrast agent, respectively, 1/T1 obs = 1/T1 t + 1/T1 c and 1/T2 obs = 1/T2 t + 1/T2 c where 1/T1 t and 1/T2 t are the relaxation rates of the tissue without contrast, and 1/T1 c and 1/T2 c are the relaxation rates attributable to the paramagnetic agent. Furthermore, 1/T1 c and 1/T2 c are linearly related to the concentration [C] of the paramagnetic contrast agent, according to the relationships 1/T1 c = r 1 [C] and 1/T2 c = r 2 [C] where r 1 and r 2 are called the specific relaxivities of the paramagnetic agent, measured in units of L/mmol-s . Although this formulation is strictly true only for contrast agents dissolved in pure solvents and lacking solute-solute interactions, clinical measurements have demonstrated that it is nevertheless a reasonable approximation for the relaxation effects of most extracellular gadolinium-containing contrast media in a variety of human tissues and tumors. The relaxivities ( r 1 and r 2 ) of most extracellular gadolinium contrast agents are comparable; for low molecular weight gadolinium chelates measured values are in the 3 - 5 L/mmol-s range. Because the r 1 and r 2 relaxivities are so similar, one might mistakenly conclude that gadolinium contrast would shorten T1 obs and T2 obs equally. This is not the case, however, because it is the relaxation rates , not relaxation times , that are additive and proportional to the concentration of gadolinium. Additionally, most biological tissues possess a marked natural disparity in their baseline relaxation times; T1 t is often 5 to 10 times longer than T2 t and therefore contributes further to the unequal effects of gadolinium on observed relaxation rates. To illustrate the apparent preferential T1 shortening effects of gadolinium at low doses, let us choose as our baseline tissue normal brain, with T1 t = 800 msec (0.8 sec) and T2 t = 80 msec (0.08 sec). Let us now suppose the blood-brain barrier becomes disrupted, and gadolinium contrast with specific relaxivities r 1 = 4 L/mmol-s and r 2 = 4 L/mmol-sec accumulates in this tissue at a concentration of 0.1 mmol/L. According to the data and equations above, the observed relaxation rates would be 1/T1 obs = (1/0.8) + (4)(0.1) = 1.65 sec 1 , and 1/T2 obs = (1/0.08) + (5)(0.1) = 13.0 sec 1 from which we calculate T1 obs = 606 msec and T2 obs = 77 msec. We can see that gadolinium has reduced the observed value of T1 by almost 25%, whereas it has diminished T2 by only 4%. In most tissues where T1 is normally much longer than T2, therefore, low concentrations of extracellular gadolinium contrast will produce a relatively greater shortening of T1 than of T2.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-does-gd-shorten-t1.html"}

In clinical practice, however, only the choline peak is noticeably affected, whose area may be significantly reduced depending on the organ, degree of enhancement, and type of contrast agent used. Gadolinium contrast does not cross an intact blood-brain-barrier, so no spectral effects are observed in non-enhancing brain lesions.

In breast imaging, for example, gadolinium may reduce the area under the choline peak as much as 40%.

The SPAIR pulse sequence is identical to SPIR except it uses a 180 adiabatic fat saturating inversion pulse. SPAIR (SPectral Attenuated Inversion Recovery) , like SPIR, is a hybrid technique combining features of both CHESS and STIR. As shown in the diagram right, the sequence begins with a 180-inverting pulse tuned to the fat resonance. This pulse inverts the longitudinal magnetization of fat so that it lies in the  z -direction. Water protons are not affected. A spoiler gradient destroys any inadvertent transverse magnetization created by the pulse. Fat, with its short T1, begins to recover quickly from this inversion and at TI its longitudinal magnetization is zero. An imaging sequence initiated at this time would generate a signal only from water protons (whose net magnetization remains locked along the +z-axis). The only substantive difference between SPAIR and SPIR is the nature of the inversion pulses. SPAIR uses an adiabatic pulses . Adiabatic inversion pulses are a special class of RF-pulses capable of accurately rotating longitudinal and transverse magnetization by exactly 180 even when the B 1 field is spatially nonuniform. Adiabatic pulses are still at the mercy of B o inhomogeneities, but are relatively intolerant to spatially dependent changes in flip angle that may occur during RF-excitation. In theory, therefore, SPAIR should provide better and more homogeneous fat suppression than SPIR. The adiabatic phenomenon and pulses have been introduced in a prior Q&A . In brief, these pulses have a quite different behavior than the more familiar amplitude-modulated sinc and gaussian pulses we have previously discussed. Adiabatic pulses are both amplitude- and frequency-modulated, meaning that their transmitted frequency changes simultaneously with amplitude as the pulse evolves. Although fat suppression is improved compared to SPIR or CHESS (FatSat) techniques, the 180-SPAIR pulses deposit more RF-energy in tissue than the smaller flip angle SPIR or CHESS pulses. The inversion time is longer in SPAIR than SPIR, so there is a greater penalty in terms of imaging time and reduced number of slices for a given TR.

Data Pre-Processing Pre-processing of RS-fMRI images is similar to that of standard fMRI studies as described in a prior Q&A. These steps include slice-timing correction, motion compensation, spatial filtering, and normalization. Temporal filtering to remove noise must be done judiciously so as not to remove relevant low-frequency resting state signals. Noise levels from motion and physiologic sources in RS-fMRI are very high; less that 5% of total signal derives from neuronal activity. Respiratory and cardiac pulsations contain frequencies close to those of resting state networks and are much more problematic for RS-fMRI than for task-based studies. Simultaneous recording of physiologic data such as heart rate, respiratory rate, or end-tidal pCO2 values may be built into the regression models. Masking of signal from ventricles, skull and white matter may also be performed. More controversial techniques applied to RS-fMRI include denoising by autocorrelation methods and removal of the average whole brain signal from the data set (global signal regression). These latter two techniques potentially may introduce or obscure anti-correlations (deactivations) in an experiment. Correlation Analysis The degree of temporal synchrony between time-series data obtained from two voxels or brain regions ( X = x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,  and Y = y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , ) can be expressed by the correlation coefficient (r) Correlation matrix for pairs of 30 different brain regions in RS-fMRI experiment. Shades of red are positive correlations, blues represent negative r -values or anti-correlations. (From nipy.org under CC license) . where r = 0 implies no correlation, r = 1 perfect correlation, and = 1 perfect anti-correlation. It is possible to perform this calculation for all pairs of voxels in the data set, resulting in over 200,000 comparisons. More frequently a \" seed \" is chosen (a predetermined voxel, cluster, or small anatomic region) and comparison made to similar seeds in the data set. A seed correlation matrix (shown left) may be constructed, where higher r -values reflect greater connectivity between paired regions. High-correlation areas can also be displayed as \"blobs\" overlaid on co-registered anatomic images. Independent Component Analysis The goal of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is to detect underlying patterns present in the fMRI signal without prior knowledge of the experimental task or shape of the hemodynamic response function. ICA is thus considered a model free method for blind source signal separation , allowing identification of unknown independent source signals that have been linearly mixed together. For example, ICA methods could be used extract individual voices, music, and noise elements from an audio mixture recorded at a cocktail party without prior knowledge of their sources or locations. Spatial ICA separates signals from visual cortex into three components. As applied to fMRI data, ICA may distinguish meaningful areas of correlated brain activation from random and semi-periodic physiological noise. Although ICA can be used in conjunction with GLM methods for task-based experiments, it has found its most widespread application for the analysis of resting-state fMRI data. The ICA algorithm begins by constructing a matrix ( Y ) of all the observed fMRI data. Each column of Y contains sequential time points for a single voxel; each row of Y is the fMRI signal at a certain time point for organized by space (all the voxels). After some pre-processing to normalize means and variances, Y is decomposed into the product of two matrices ( T and S ), where T is a matrix of time courses and S is a matrix of spatial components. The values in T and S are iteratively adjusted to determine a decomposition that maximizes statistical independence (typically between rows of S ). The resultant independent component signals can then be color-coded and overlaid on an anatomic image (above). Other Methods Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) measures the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of its nearest neighbors, providing information about local connectivity Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) quantifies the intensity of spontaneous low-frequency oscillations in the BOLD signal, which are thought to reflect spontaneous neural activity Graph Theory Analysis models the brain as a network of nodes (brain regions) and edges (functional connections), allowing for the calculation of various network metrics such as centrality, clustering, and efficiency .

In conventional spin-echo (CSE) imaging, only two basic timing parameters are required to be specified, repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) . In fast/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) imaging, simple TE is replaced by effective echo time (TE eff ) , the time at which the central lines of k -space are being filled. Additionally, two new parameters are needed: Number of echoes -- called echo train length (ETL) by GE and Canon; turbo factor by Siemens and Philips; or shot factor by Hitachi. Time between echoes -- called echo spacing (ESP) by GE, Philips, Siemens, and Canon; interecho time (ITE) by Hitachi. Increased T2 weighting with increasing ETL. All images TR =4000 and other parameters unchanged Echo train length (ETL) is the single most important parameter. In general, image acquisition time is inversely proportional to ETL. In other words, if a CSE sequence with a certain TR/TE/spatial resolution takes 8 minutes to perform, a FSE sequence with ETL=8 would take only 1 minute. ETL also has important effects on image quality. Longer ETLs result in more T2-weighting because more late echoes with longer TE's contribute to the overall signal. Longer ETL's are also associated with a decrease in overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) because the later echoes are weaker. The use of later echoes at very long TE's also produces more spatial blurring. This spatial blurring effect results from T2-related signal loss on late echoes; recall that these echoes are obtained with higher-order phase encodings corresponding to high spatial frequencies and details in the image. The number of slices required to cover an anatomical region in a given TR interval should also be considered in selection of ETL . In conventional two-dimensional Fourier transform (2DFT) SE imaging, recall that the \"dead time\" at the end of each TR interval is not wasted; this time is used to excite other slices in the multislice acquisition (see this prior Q&A if you need a review). A tradeoff exists in FSE imaging between the ETL and the number allowed slices for a given TR . If the ETL is too large, two separate FSE acquisitions (with double the imaging time) may be required to encompass the required number of sections. Increasing echo spacing (ESP) permits the use of longer TE's but adversely impacts SNR and CNR. Motion, susceptibility, and edge-related artifacts increase. In general, increased ESP has predominantly deleterious consequences on image quality; the shortest permitted ESP should therefore be chosen in most applications. Image contrast can be made to resemble that of a conventional SE technique by clustering the collection of low-order phase-encoding steps near the TE value desired. This may be done because global image contrast is determined principally from signals acquired at the low-order phase-encoding steps at the center of k -space (the high-order steps contribute mostly to edge detail at the periphery of k -space). Therefore, although each echo in a train has been acquired with a different TE , the effective TE dictating overall image contrast is determined by the TE at which the low-order steps were performed. This is generally chosen to be in the middle of the train of echoes, but may be moved to the front or the end of the series in special applications.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fse-parameters.html"}

In earlier literature, this sequence was known by the acronym  FADE (FAst Double Echo). GE's version is called MENSA (Multi-Echo iN Steady-state Acquisition). By means of a prolonged and unbalanced readout gradient, DESS generates the FID-like and Echo-like signals from the steady-state free precession individually. It then combines the signals on a pixel-by-pixel basis, thereby increasing signal-to-noise. Phase-encoding and slice-select gradients are balanced to maintain the transverse steady state. DESS knee image TR/TE/ = 18/3/25 The contrast of DESS is unique as it combines features from both the FID-signal of FISP with the Echo-signal of PSIF. Fluid is extremely bright (reflecting T2/T1 weighting from the PSIF echo signal). Bone is relatively dark due to T2* dephasing from trabeculae (reflecting susceptibility sensitivity of the FISP/FID component). The PSIF/echo contribution makes DESS very sensitive to motion, so its use has been primarily limited to orthopedic applications, such as 3D knee imaging.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dess.html"}

Diffusion imaging of organs with small cross-sections like the prostate and spinal cord is frequently desired. In these cases the surrounding tissues may be of no interest and serve only to contribute noise and aliasing artifacts. Accordingly, so small field-of-view (FOV) methods have been developed to exclude these unwanted regions. These can be used not only for DWI but routine imaging as well. Two of the oldest approaches to small FOV imaging derive from MR spectroscopy. Inner volume excitation uses either 2 or 3 perpendicularly applied RF-pulses to excite voxels only along their intersection (a column of voxels or single voxel respectively). Alternatively, outer volume suppression bands can be used to null signal from tissues outside the desired imaging volume. Inner volume excitation using the STEAM pulse sequence. Three orthogonal RF pulses excite only a single voxel at their intersection. Outer volume suppression bands dephase/null magnetization of tissues outside the area of interest (here the prostate) A variant of inner volume excitation has recently been developed and now offered as product by the major vendors as FOCUS (GE), ZOOMit (Siemens), and iZOOM (Philips). These sequences employ a special 2D RF excitation pulse that is spatially selective in both the slice select and phase-encoding directions. It takes the place of the 1D slice-selective 90-pulse used in conventional EPI sequences. Details of a sample 2D RF-pulse used for a small FOV sequence are shown in the diagram below. The 2D RF \"pulse\" is a composite of approximately 25 closely spaced \"sub-pulses\" extending over a time frame of about 15 ms. This RF excitation is played out simultaneously with a fast (oscillatory) gradient along the phase-encode axis and a slow (\"blipped\") gradient along slice-select. Slice thickness in both phase- and slice-select directions can be independently controlled. Orienting the fast gradient along the phase-encode axis allows for a very sharp profile and minimizes aliasing. The slow (\"blipped\") gradient has a much lower bandwidth, and orienting it along the slice-select axis means that fat-water chemical shift displacements will occur in this direction. By choosing the main lobe of water to be on-resonance during refocusing, \"fat ghosting\" artifacts common in EPI can be largely eliminated.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Until the last two decades, the presence of a cardiac pacemaker was considered an absolute contraindication for MR imaging. The traditional 5 Gauss safety line (beyond which the general unscreened public must not pass) is still in use, having been based upon the approximate field at which the reed switches in older pacemakers may be affected. The reasons traditionally cited in support of excluding pacemaker patients from MRI include: Over a dozen documented deaths and non-fatal but serious injuries (such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy from cardiac arrest) have been reported in pacemaker patients inadvertently subjected to MR scanning. The actual worldwide number of similar but unreported events is likely to be much higher. Temporary pacemaker malfunction during the scan leading to cardiac arrhythmias or impaired cardiac output can occur due to inhibition of pacing output, over- or under-sensing, unpredictable opening/closure of the reed switch, alteration of programming, overly rapid pacing, and device power-on reset. Permanent electromagnetic field damage to pacemaker electronics or battery necessitating pacemaker replacement may occur. RF-induced heating at the electrode tip via the antenna effect ( see separate Q&A ) has been demonstrated experimentally and may be manifest by increased lead resistance/capture threshold. An additional hazard unique to internal cardiac defibrillators (ICD's) exists  false interpretation of RF-pulses as ventricular tachyarrhythmia and deliverance of cardioversion/defibrillation shocks. As the turn of the century approached, some centers (including ours) began to perform MRI's in selected pacemaker patients for whom clinical benefit was thought to outweigh these potential risks. We did this with some trepidation and were exceedingly cautious at first, initially having cardiologist transvenous pacer in hand and a cardiac nurse ready with drugs in the event of an emergency. But over time, we learned that this heightened level of preparedness was not usually necessary and that many patients with even older pacemakers could be scanned safely with thorough pre-procedure evaluation by a cardiologist and radiologist and moderate supervision during the scan. In the mean time, the medical device industry responded by producing MR Conditional pacemakers, the first models appearing in 2007, with many more continuing to be developed.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/pacemaker-dangers.html"}

Bolus-chase CE MRA using 3 stations The technique of \"bolus-chase\" contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) was first described in the late 1990's as a method for imaging lower extremity peripheral arterial disease. The earliest techniques involved injection of a relatively large quantity of intravenous contrast (~40-60 mL) with 3D gradient echo imaging performed sequentially over three stations: pelvis, upper leg, and lower leg. The MR table was manually moved as fast as possible between stations to image the entire vascular tree in one injection. Over the last 15 years bolus-chase techniques have become more refined and complex, with clinical results rivaling CTA and subtraction angiography. Such advancements are too numerous to fully explain on this website, but several are provided in the references below. These innovations include: 1) continuous table movement; 2) parallel imaging with high acceleration factors; 3) real-time fluoroscopic bolus tracking; 4) time-resolved imaging; 5) hybrid techniques; 6) specific imaging parameters optimized to individual patient physiology; 7) station-specific imaging parameters and view ordering; 8) use of blood-pool contrast agents; and 9) innovative 3D k -space acquisition strategies based on projection-reconstruction and vastly undersampled (sparse data) with compressed sensing. With the lesson of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis always in mind, the use of high-volume contrast is no longer a realistic option for most patients. Thus any bolus chase method must be performed using a modest contrast dose, which for an average-size adult limits volumes to about 20 mL. Some sites dilute their contrast by 25-50% allowing higher volumes (but the same total gadolinium dose) to be administered. At our institution, depending on clinical indication, we generally use a hybrid technique for peripheral CE-MRA. We begin by injecting about  of the available contrast dose and performing time-resolved imaging over the most distal portion of the extremities. We then inject the remainder of the contrast and image the pelvis and entire lower extremities (3-stations, in that order) using a fluoroscopically-triggered bolus-chase technique. We typically use a spoiled 3D-GRE sequence with primary direction in the coronal plane at short TE and with parallel-imaging acceleration and elliptical-centric view order.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/bolus-chasing.html"}

Stress perfusion MRI is typically performed in patients with known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis to identify areas of inducible ischemia, to predict cardiac prognosis, to stratify risk for non-cardiac surgery, or to assess myocardial viability. The underlying principle is that myocardial dysfunction (impaired wall motion and/or perfusion) may sometimes be seen only when the distal myocardial capillary bed is maximally dilated during cardiac stress. In echocardiography suites stress is typically induced by exercise using a treadmill or stationary bicycle. As these devices are impractical in the MR imaging suite, modern CMR employs pharmacologic \"stress\" created by intravenous infusion of a vasodilator (adenosine/regadenoson) or positive inotrope (dobutamine). Gadolinium contrast to assess perfusion is administered to all patients except those with severe allergies or renal insufficiency. Delayed T1-weighted images at 10-20 minutes are also usually acquired to look for delayed myocardial enhancement. Both stress and rest MR images are carefully compared, with disparities between wall motion, perfusion, and delayed enhancement essential for diagnosis. Inducible ischemia (dark area, arrow) in the anteroseptal cardiac wall noted on perfusion study during stress but not at rest. Prior to performing a stress perfusion procedure, the following preparatory steps are essential Renal function testing . Because of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium cannot be given safely to patients with severe renal disease and should be administered in reduced dosage for patients with renal insufficiency. If there is any suspicion of renal disease a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should generally be obtained prior to gadolinium administration. Cardiac troponin testing . Cardiac troponins are enzymes released by damaged myocardium. As pharmacological stress testing is generally contraindicated after a recent myocardial infarction, measurement of serum troponins should be performed in the appropriate clinical setting. Medical history review . In addition to recent myocardial infarction, pharmacological stress testing may be contraindicated in patients with acute myocarditis/pericarditis, progressive unstable angina, rapid arrhythmias, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, and other disorders. Questioning the patient about reactive airway disease should always be performed, as regadenoson (Lexiscan) would likely be preferred over adenosine in this clinical scenario. Informed consent . Pharmacological stress testing confers additional rare but significant risks to the patient, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, seizures, stroke, and even death. Hence a formal signed consent and discussion with the patient is required. Start 2 IVs . Gadolinium and adenosine cannot be given through the same line, so two separate IVs are required. Separate lines are optional if regadenoson or dobutamine is used. Avoidance of stimulants . Patients should be advised not to consume stimulants such as coffee, tea, caffeinated sodas, energy drinks, and chocolate within 12-24 hours of the scan. Dipyridamole (Persantine) and dipyridamole-containing medications (Aggrenox) should generally be discontinued for 48 hours. All these stimulants and medications can interfere with the efficacy of the pharmacological stress testing and interpretation of the examination. Equipment, staffing, and safety . Stress CMR carries small but significant risks and so a team of nurses, techs, and cardiologists must be ready to mange acute complications such as hypotension, myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and respiratory insufficiency. MRI-compatible monitoring equipment, drugs (especially -blockers, bronchodilators, aminophylline, and nitroglycerine), defibrillator, and full emergency cart with temporary pacemaker should be readily available. An emergency resuscitation policy should be in place with training/practice sessions for staff to handle situations requiring urgent response. The usual stress-rest CMR protocol varies somewhat among centers and by specific clinical indication, but generally follows a sequence of steps similar to those listed below: Anatomic survey using SSFP localizers plus 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber dark/bright blood views. Resting wall motion study using SSFP-cine (short axis view essential plus others) Stressor agent infusion .

We prefer gadobenate (MultiHance) at 0.05 mmol/kg due to its high relaxivity and safety profile. This is one-half of the \"standard\" (0.1 mmol/kg) dose, the other half given later in the procedure. Stress perfusion module acquiring ~50 images using first-pass SSFP or GRE technique. Optional stress wall motion study (identical to step 2) Wait 10 minutes . May perform other anatomic or flow imaging during this period. Second \"half-dose\" gadolinium injection . Resting perfusion module . Identical to step 5 but without adenosine/stressor agent. Wait 10 minutes (to allow Gd uptake into myocardium) Delayed enhancement imaging .

Most MRA techniques, including time-of-flight (TOF) methods, can be performed using either a 2D or 3D acquisition mode. 2D TOF is commonly used for imaging of long vascular segments running perpendicular to the plane of imaging (like the aorta or femoral arteries). The 3D mode is used for more compact anatomic regions with various flow directions (like the carotid bifurcation, circle of Willis, or renal arteries). 2D TOF images of the cervical arteries 2D TOF MR Angiography . Multiple thin (1-2 mm-thick) slices are obtained as a stack in a plane perpendicular to the course of the imaged blood vessels. TR values are kept short (<30 ms) to suppress background tissues and accentuate flow-related enhancement. The slices in 2D TOF MRA are acquired sequentially; complete data for each slice is collected before moving on to the next slice. A traveling saturation band about 4 cm wide is generally placed on the upstream side of each slice to suppress contaminating signal from venous inflow. The 2D method offers short imaging times with excellent sensitivity to slow flow. Imaging of long vascular segments is possible (such as the entire aorta or lower extremity arteries) by simply increasing the number of slices. Disadvantages of 2D imaging include insensitivity to in-plane flow and patient motion artifacts that may create misregistration. 3D TOF MR Angiography . The 3D TOF mode is used where the imaged anatomy encompasses a relatively small area and vessels run in various orientations. 3D methods offer high spatial resolution and high signal-to-noise. Nearly isotropic (square) voxels may be obtained, allowing reformation in any direction. Disadvantages of 3D TOF MRA include relative insensitivity to slow flow and saturation effects that limit maximum slab thickness of each acquisition.

As a result of this complexity, no simple formula exists to predict I based on the number of protons and neutrons within an atom. Nevertheless, there are some general rules that apply to special cases: Internal structure of the proton: 2 \"up\" quarks and one \"down\" quark held together by the strong nuclear force mediated by gluons 1) Even/Even . Nuclei containing even numbers of both protons and neutrons have I = 0 and therefore cannot undergo NMR. Examples include 4 He, 12 C, 16 O and 32 S. 2) Odd/Odd .

For even-numbered elements, the principal isotope will nearly always have I =0, but there will be one or more less abundant isotopes that are NMR-active. For example, the most common naturally occurring isotope of carbon (C) contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons. According to Rule #1 above, C has I = 0 and cannot undergo NMR. However, carbon's C isotope (natural abundance 1.07%) contains one extra neutron, resulting in a net spin ( I = ) and permitting its use in NMR.

As a first approximation, therefore, the 180-pulse appears to be acting only upon the transverse components of magnetization.

What you are referring to is hyperpolarized noble gas imaging wherein the NMR signal from inhaled xenon ( 129 Xe) or helium ( 3 He) is recorded. This technique, largely confined to research centers, holds promise for anatomic imaging of lung ventilation as well as functional imaging of gas exchange. Hyperpolarized 129 Xe MR image of the lungs Both 129 Xe and 3 He are spin =  nuclei with gyromagnetic ratios (  ) of approximately 11.8 and 32.4 MHz/T respectively. (The negative 's mean they precess in a direction opposite to H.) Because these gases can only be inhaled in low concentrations, their baseline magnetization levels must be substantially increased to obtain usable MR signals. This is done through the process of hyperpolarization described in more detail below. During the first decade (c. 2000-2010) of hyperpolarized noble gas MR imaging, 3 He was much more widely used than 129 Xe. Unlike 129 Xe, 3 He has no systemic anesthetic effects and with its higher nuclear sensitivity is superior for direct visualization of air-space morphology. However, 129 Xe has several characteristics not shared by 3 He  solubility in blood (allowing it to be used as a peripheral perfusion agent), wide range of chemical shifts (220 ppm between gas and dissolved phases), and low diffusivity  all of which may be exploited for unique applications. Since about 2010 a severe international shortage of 3 He has occurred, driven in no small part by its widespread use in neutron detectors for anti-terrorism purposes. Prices have increased 20-fold, and since that time 129 Xe has become the dominant gas used for MR imaging. Performing noble gas imaging requires a substantial investment in time and technology. The MR scanner must be outfitted with a second separate multinuclear spectroscopy \"front end\", including transmit/receive amplifiers and coils tuned to the lower resonant frequencies of 129 Xe and 3 He. In a room nearby is a hyperpolarization system required to produce, store, and quantify the gas produced. Special imaging pulse sequences are also required, which are typically either 2D breath-hold GRE or 3D undersampled radial acquisitions. Large size single voxel spectroscopy images may be obtained, estimating the fraction of Xe dissolved in tissue and blood by its chemical shift. Diffusion weighted imaging of Xe is also possible. 129 Xe spectrum in lung showing gas and two dissolved phases, one in tissue/plasma at 197 ppm and the other in red blood cells (RBCs) at 218 ppm.

The multistep process begins by mixing 129 Xe gas and rubidium (Rb) vapor in a sterile chamber. Rb is a Group I alkali metal just below potassium (K) in the periodic table, with a single outer shell valence electron. By stimulation with a polarized laser, these electrons become excited and can transfer energy to 129 Xe nuclei during interatomic collisions. This process pumps up the magnetization of 129 Xe to a level over 100,000 times higher than at normal thermal equilibrium, allowing a detectable NMR signal to be subsequently generated. The hyperpolarized 129 Xe is separated from the Rb by freezing in a receptacle called the \"cold finger\".

Since frequency-encoding seems relatively simple and straightforward, why make things complicated by introducing phase-encoding, parallel imaging, and other confusing concepts?

This sounds like a great idea at first, but a few sketches will show you that it is impossible to construct a gradient field so that each pixel in a slice or volume has a unique frequency. No matter how such a gradient is designed, there will always be two or more voxels with the same frequency; therefore, a scheme based on assigning a unique frequency to every point in a subject simultaneously is not tenable. It is possible, however, to oscillate the gradients so that over time each pixel is assigned a unique frequency or physically move the patient within the magnet from point to point. Both these strategies were used in the early days of MR imaging and were known as sensitive point techniques .

To avoid respiratory motion artifacts, single-voxel acquisition during breath holding is preferred. A voxel is typically placed over the right lobe of the liver, avoiding larger vessels, bile ducts, and obvious masses. The STEAM technique is preferred over PRESS because it is less sensitive to J -coupling effects and provides more accurate estimate of fat fraction. Neither fat nor water suppression pulses are used. TR should be breater than 3000 ms to minimize T1 relaxation effects. Multi-echo acquisition with different TEs allows correction for T2 relaxation effects.

Laminar flow refers to a predictable distribution of flow velocities in layers (lamina) that parallel the vessel wall. This form of flow is idealized but is nevertheless a fairly good approximation of the flow in medium- and small-sized blood vessels throughout the human circulatory system. Theoretically, the distribution of velocities in a perfectly straight, nonbranching vessel with nonpulsatile flow should be parabolic in cross-section, with peak velocities at the center of the lumen. In real vessels, however, the flow profile is usually more blunted because of elasticity and pulsatility effects, even though the general laminar pattern may be maintained. When the flow profile becomes flattened in this form with a nearly uniform distribution of velocities across the lumen, the term plug flow is sometimes applied. Development of turbulent flow in a jet Turbulent flow is a chaotic form of fluid transport in which velocity components randomly fluctuate. Turbulence takes place when blood velocities exceed a critical threshold or when vascular morphology creates conditions that disrupt the laminar flow state. In the human circulatory system, turbulent flow is seen in the aorta, in the region of vascular bifurcations, and distal to areas of stenosis. In ideal fluids, turbulence can be predicted on the basis of the calculated value of a dimensionless parameter known as the Reynolds number (Re) Re =  d V /  where  and  are the fluid's density and viscosity, d is the diameter of the vessel, and V is the flow velocity. Values of Re less than 2000 predict that flow will be laminar, whereas values greater than 2500 usually indicate that flow will be turbulent. Vortex flow refers to localized swirling or stagnant blood flow that has separated from the central streamlines within a vessel. Such vortices, also called flow eddies , frequently occur at vascular bifurcations and distal to areas of stenosis. Unlike turbulent regions, areas of vortex flow are composed of slowly moving currents and streamlines that are not random but are often countercurrent to the main flow direction.

The volume transfer constant ( K trans ) reflects the efflux rate of gadolinium contrast from blood plasma into the tissue extravascular extracellular space (EES) . K trans depends on three factors: plasma blood flow (F), vascular permeability (P) , and capillary surface area (S) per unit mass. In practice the individual contributions of permeability and surface area cannot clearly separated and it is therefore common to consider them together as the so-called PS product . Volume transfer rate of gadolinium (black dots) into tissue ( K trans ) depends on blood (plasma) flow ( F ), permeability ( P ), and vascular surface area ( S ) As shown in the diagram below, two capillary networks with the same blood flows and PS products will transport gadolinium into tissue at the same rates, even though their permeabilities and surface areas may differ. Two different capillary networks with the same flows ( F ) and PS products and hence identical K trans values In general the individual contributions of F , P , and S to K trans cannot be separated. Two limiting cases, however, shed some light on the relative importance and interaction of these three factors. Case 1 (Permeability limited) . In this case, pictured below left, plasma blood flow ( F ) is much greater than the PS product. Plenty of gadolinium is delivered to tissue and the amount transferred into the interstitial space depends solely on the size and permeability of the capillary bed. In this situation, K trans = PS. Case 2 (Flow limited) . Here plasma blood flow ( F ) is much smaller than the PS product. In this case virtually all the gadolinium leaks into the EES before reaching the venous side of the capillary bed. In this situation, K trans = F.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/k-trans--permeability.html"}

Why would anyone want to buy a lower field strength scanner? Although superconducting magnets of field strength 1.5T and higher dominate the MR marketplace, lower field scanners do often certain advantages. 1) Open design . The use of permanent and resistive magnets allow for these scanners to have a smaller physical footprints, wider bores, and a variety of configurations to maximize patient comfort and minimize claustrophobia. Open design also permits access to the patient for interventional MRI procedures. 2) Lower initial purchase price . As a rule scanner purchase price increases with field strength. The relationship is not linear, but a 0.35T permanent magnet system might cost only one-third to one-half that of a 1.5T superconducting unit. 3) Lower operational costs . Lower field permanent magnet scanners do not require liquid helium or special maintenance. ( Resistive electromagnet scanners, however, consume large amounts of energy to produce the field and cool the coils during scanning and have relatively high operational costs.) 4) Lower fringe field . This means it is easier (and cheaper) to site and shield the magnet within a hospital or imaging center. Projectile risks to patients and personnel are reduced. Anesthesia and monitoring equipment may be brought closer to a low-field scanner. 5) Reduction of certain MR artifacts . Chemical shift, susceptibility, and flow/motion artifacts are often less apparent on images from lower field scanners. The biggest advantage may be for scanning patients with metal hardware, where susceptibility-induced spatial distortions and signal loss are typically much reduced compared to those obtained at high-fields. 6) Lower energy deposition in tissues . The amount of energy deposited in tissues by radiofrequency pulses (called the Specific Absorption Rate or SAR ) is proportional to the square of the magnetic field strength. High SAR can cause dangerous heating in infants and sick/elderly patients who cannot regulate their body temperatures, so lower field scanners hold an advantage here. 7) Portability . In 2020 the world's first portable MR scanner, the Hyperfine Swoop, began commercial sales in the US, made possible by innovative design and ultra-low field (0.064T).

South and North poles For convenience and standardization (but really no other good reason), the patient table end of a scanner is usually taken to be the South pole and the far back \"service\" end the North pole. The direction of the B o field is therefore from front (Z) to back (+Z) along the bore of the scanner. However, this is an entirely arbitrary choice and could vary by installation. In the past clinical scanners had relatively large fringe fields, and when two or more scanners were sited near each other in a facility, some consideration had to be given to the polarity of each magnet. In these situations magnetic fringe fields and interactions were minimized by configuring the magnets so that the unlike poles faced each other.

It seems like they should do all work the same way. Both frequency-encoding gradients and phase-encoding gradients do work in exactly the same way, but are used for different purposes. All imaging gradients temporarily change the resonant frequencies of protons while the gradient is being applied. When the gradient is turned off, the protons go back to their original precession frequencies. However, these protons will have gained or lost phase relative to a reference state though they are now again resonating at the same frequency. They possess \"memory\" of their historical encounter with the gradient manifest by a permanent phase shift (). Signals from a reference proton and a proton subjected to a gradient. The red dot represents the 11th peak of each signal. The gradient causes the lower proton to accumulate more cycles with a resultant permanent phase shift () even after the gradient has been turned off. The magnitude of the accumulated phase shift () is proportional to the strength of the gradient ( G ) and the time ( t ) that gradient is applied, reflected in the equation  =   G  t. By convention, application of a gradient in an MR pulse timing diagram the gradient strength is often indicated by a rectangle, where the height of the rectangle represents gradient strength ( G ) and its width reflects time ( t ) the gradient has been applied.

SPIR sequence combines features of CHESS (fat-selective RF pulse + spoiler) and STIR (inversion recovery nulling of fat signal). SPIR stands for  Spectral Presaturation with Inversion Recovery  and is pictured right. SPIR is a hybrid technique that combines a fat-selective RF-pulse and spoiler gradient (similar to CHESS) together with nulling of the residual longitudinal fat magnetization through an inversion delay mechanism (similar to STIR). These spin manipulations purely involve fat; the water resonance is unaffected. After a suitable inversion time to null residual fat signal, any pulse sequence can be used to image the remaining water. Typically a T1-weighted sequence is employed. Unlike CHESS, where a 90  -pulse is considered ideal, the RF-pulse in SPIR is intended to partially or completely invert the fat magnetization. The RF-pulse flip angle in SPIR is therefore set in the 100  -180  range. Any transverse magnetization components of fat created by this RF-pulse are dephased by the spoiler gradient. The residual (inverted) longitudinal magnetization of fat is then allowed to regrow via T1 relaxation over the next 100-200 msec. MR signal generation begins when the M z for fat is zero, so fat does not contribute to the final image. Why is this extra inversion step necessary? It clearly uses up valuable time and makes SPIR sequences longer and more slice-inefficient than a simple CHESS technique. The reason for this added complexity is that a perfect 90  -pulse (as required for simple CHESS) is impossible to achieve in practice. Due to B 1 (RF)-inhomogeneities, some fat spins are flipped at angles greater or lesser than 90  . These spins continue to have longitudinal components of magnetization that are not destroyed by the spoiler gradient, and ultimately contribute undesirably to the final MR signal. By selecting a flip angle greater than 90  SPIR insures that residual longitudinal fat magnetization is inverted and then nulled during the TI interval. The simplest form of SPIR sequence described above is most widely used on Philips scanners, where it has long been their default method of fat suppression. I have been told Philips SPIR has a default RF-flip angle of about 110. After an interactive shimming process, Philips users can then optimize the sequence by adjusting the precise frequency offset of the inverting pulse as well as the inversion time ( TI ). GE has similar sequence called SPECIAL (SPECtral Inversion At Lipid) that uses a flip angle closer to 100. Other major vendors like Siemens, Hitachi, and Canon offer SPAIR pulses instead. The SPIR technique does a reasonably good job of suppressing fat. Like other chemical-shift based sequences, however, SPIR suffers tissue-related susceptibility and dielectric effects that cause inhomogeneity of the B o and B 1 fields. This is manifest by incomplete fat suppression (and even water suppression) in certain regions of the image. T1-weighted images without and with SPIR. Note incomplete fat suppression at edges due to inhomogeneity effects.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/spir.html"}

The Faraday-Lenz principle of magnetic induction. A voltage (V) is generated in the coil proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field (dB/dt). The induced current opposes the applied field. The source of the changing magnetic fields in MRI may either be the imaging gradients or radiofrequency (RF) coils. The conductive material in which eddy currents are induced may be any metallic component of the MR scanner (other coils, shields, tubes, and housing), wires or devices within or on the patient, and the patient as a whole (in the final analysis, people are just big bags of saline!) Electrolux induction cooktop. An oscillating magnetic field in the cooktop induces eddy currents in the pan, heating and melting the chocolate. The cooktop itself does not get hot. The Faraday-Lenz Law of electromagnetism states that electrical currents are induced in nearby conductors by a changing magnetic field. Since MR uses rapidly changing magnetic fields to generate and spatially define the signal, swirling ('eddy') currents are always produced whenever imaging is performed. Currents are generated in a nearby conductor whenever a changing magnetic field is present. Because they swirl like eddies in a river, they are called \"eddy currents\". Eddy currents within the patient may produce important biological effects such as tissue heating or peripheral nerve stimulation. These concepts deserve several Q&A's of their own and are considered in detail in the Quality and Safety section of this website. The present discussion deals with eddy currents induced in the MR scanner itself. Within the MR scanner, eddy currents are induced any any nearby conducting media, which include within the gradient coils themselves, the main magnet and shim coil windings, cryoshields, liquid helium vessel, and RF shields. Eddy currents create two undesired phenomena: unwanted time-varying gradients and shifts in the main magnetic field ( B o ). Nyquist N/2 ghost artifact As per Faraday's Law, the magnitude of eddy currents depends on the rate of change of the inciting magnetic field. Thus fast imaging sequences (where gradients are pulsed on and off quickly) produce the largest and most severe eddy current problems. Echo-planar imaging sequences are especially affected where a characteristic eddy current artifact ( Nyquist N/2 ghost ) is commonly seen. Other sequences that may be most affected by eddy-currents include diffusion-weighted imaging, MR spectroscopy, MR angiography, balanced gradient echo sequences, and any sequence with a very short TE . Eddy currents degrade the speed and efficiency of gradient switching; electrical pulses driving the gradients become distorted, producing a wide range of image artifacts, including shearing, shading, scaling, blurring, and spatial misregistration. Eddy currents within the cryostat produce Joule heating, degrading the quality of the magnetic field and resulting an increased boil-off of cryogens. Several techniques are available to minimize the effects of eddy currents: 1) Design methods that interrupt potential current loops (use of slotted coils and shields) 2) Active shielding of gradients (secondary coils outside to constrain magnetic flux changes induced by primary gradients); 3) Pre-emphasis (modifying the input current to the gradients to account for expected eddy-current distortions); and 4) Image post-processing (to correct for spatial nonlinearities and frequency/phase shifts due to eddy currents) These methods will be described in more detail in subsequent questions.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/eddy-current-problems.html"}

Continuous quality control (QC) is mandatory whether or not an MR facility decides to become accredited. Most of the routine (daily/weekly) tests are performed by an MR technologist. More detailed calibration and testing on a semiannual or yearly basis requires a skilled service engineer or medical physicist. Daily QC activities include visual inspection of all scanner hardware, the function of safety and communication devices, and general assessment of image quality including identification of artifacts. On at least a weekly basis, a special MR phantom is placed in the scanner and various measurements are made and recorded. Such measurements include landmark accuracy (table position), center frequency, image uniformity, transmitter gain or attenuation, geometric distortion, spatial resolution, artifact evaluation, and signal-to-noise ratio. Maximum acceptable variances for each measurement are established (e.g., table position < 1 mm, center frequency < 1 ppm). These are recorded in a log as shown below: Major MRI vendors offer software packages that perform automated daily quality assurance measurements using their own phantoms. GEs Daily Automated Quality Assurance (DAQA) system acquires 4 mulitplanar images on a test phantom, then calculates and tracks center frequency, transmit gain, SNR, ghosting, and geometric accuracy. Upon delivery of a new scanner and every 6-12 months a more detailed Image quality assessment by a trained physicist or engineer should be performed. These tests include measurement of magnetic field homogeneity, slice position accuracy, slice thickness accuracy, spatial resolution tests, artifact analysis, and RF coil calibration.

SPIO nanoparticles In the mid-1990's several iron-based MR contrast agents were designed to undergo uptake into the phagocytic cells of the liver, primarily macrophages ( Kupffer cells ) and sinusoidal endothelial cells. These agents were colloid suspensions of dextran-coated iron oxide molecules forming single magnetic domains, thus demonstrating superparamagnetism ( a property stronger than paramagnetism but not as powerful as ferromagnetism). Because their diameters were measured in nanometers (nm), these agents became known as superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nano particles . The largest of these nanoparticles (50-100 nm) were found to undergo rapid uptake by the liver. Smaller particles (10-50 nm), often called Ultrasmall SPIOs (US-SPIOs or USPIOs) remained in the blood for many hours and were only slowly phagocytized by the liver. These latter agents continue to excite interest as intravascular and lymphatic contrast agents, discussed further in the next two Q&As. T2-weighted image obtained 30 minutes after administration of Ferridex. Normally functioning liver becomes dark while lesions like this metastasis (arrow) remain bright. The two most widely marketed SPIO liver agents were Feridex (Endorem) and Resovist (Cliavist) . Although these agents shortened T1, their dominant effect when accumulating in the liver was to preferentially reduce T2 and T2* by bulk susceptibility effects When a T2- or T2*-weighted pulse sequence was performed, normal areas of liver and spleen (that naturally accumulated the contrast agents) showed reduced signal intensity, while tumors, cysts, and other lesions did not change intensity and remained bright. Notwithstanding initial enthusiasm for these agents, they failed commercially because their diagnostic utility was simply not proved. Although most cancers did not have SPIO uptake, several benign and malignant hepatocellular lesions including focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hemangiomas would occasionally accumulate the agents. As a result, by 2012 manufacturers of both agents discontinued global production and sales. Today, Resovist is available as a liver agent only in Japan.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/feridex--liver-agents.html"}

Why couldn't all the spins be whole numbers, or for that matter, any value whatsoever? The fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that many basic phenomena at the atomic level (such as energy emission and angular momentum) appear to be quantized. Quantized means that when certain properties of a system are measured, a continuous range of results are not observed, but rather a set of discrete (separate) values. If quanta come in discrete units then it makes sense to count them with integers. The idea of a spin =  particle was at first met with skepticism by much of the scientific community. It was not until 1928 when Paul Dirac directly derived this result for the electron from relativistic quantum mechanics that half-integer quantum numbers became widely accepted. Some appreciation for why both integer and half-integer quantum numbers crop up may be gained by considering the properties of simple standing waves, such as vibrations of a guitar string. It is well recognized that standing waves only occur when their harmonics are either whole or half-integral multiples of the string length. The guitar string example is only an analogy, not a proof, of why both whole and half-integer spin values might be reasonable at the quantum level. I present this to provide you with some comfort that all quantum features are not entirely foreign to our experience in the macroscopic world. Harmonic vibrations of a string follow a progression of wavelengths () similar to spin quantum numbers: 1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, 5/2, etc.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-i--frac12-1-etc.html"}

Because water and fat protons have slightly different resonance frequencies, their spins go in- and out-of-phase with each other as a function of time. The period of this phase cycling is 1/f, where f is the frequency offset between the spins. Thus at 1.5T, the phase cycling period is 1/220 Hz or about 4.5 msec. (To simplify the discussion below I have rounded this number down to an even 4.4 msec). In-phase and out-of-phase conditions occur twice per cycle, or approximately every 2.2 msec at 1.5T. (At 3.0T the phase cycling is twice as fast, occurring every 1.1 msec). GRE images obtained at 1.5T at TE 's of 2.2, 6.6, 11.0 msec are called out-of-phase (OOP) ; those obtained at 4.4, 8.8, etc. are called in-phase (IP) . Phase-cycling between fat and water at 1.5T By the late 1980's several investigators began to realize that this phase cancellation effect could be used clinically to identify and even quantify the fat content of tissues like the liver. One particularly common use of this principle today is to help in the differentiation of adrenal adenomas (that typically contain fat) from carcinomas and metastases (that do not). The diagnosis of a variety of other abdominal lesions, including angiomyolipomas, renal clear cell carcinoma, and focal fatty infiltration of the liver may be assisted by IP-OOP imaging. The technique, illustrated below, involves obtaining a pair of GRE images at the same TR but with two different TE values, one IP and the second OOP. Lesions whose signal intensities drop significantly on the OOP images are likely to contain microscopic fat. Accordingly, IP/OOP scanning is now a standard part of most abdominal imaging protocols world-wide. Lipid-rich adrenal adenoma (arrow).

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Like spinal cord stimulation, the primary indication for peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) is localized or regional pain refractory to conventional therapies. A variety of purely external transcutaneous stimulation devices ( Aleve Direct Therapy and other TENS units; H-WAVE  , ActiPatch ) or percutaneous neuromodulation devices that are predominantly external but have wires or needles passing through the skin ( PNT, Deepwave, SPRINT ) will not be discussed further here. These are all MR Unsafe and must be removed prior to MRI. Instead this Q&A will focus on peripheral neurostimulators with electrodes that are completely implanted. The earliest implanted peripheral neurostimulators utilized similar technology to then existing spinal cord stimulators and were MR Unsafe. Examples include the Renew, Genesis , and Eon Systems ( Abbott/St. Jude ) and the Legacy L300 foot drop system ( Bioness ). Most, but not all, modern PNS systems do not contain implanted pulse generators and are MR Conditional. The StimWave StimQ ( StimWave Technologies ) exemplifies this new generation of PNS devices. The implanted lead is only 1 mm in diameter and can be percutaneously inserted through a needle. It contains an antenna, microcircuitry, and 4-9 terminal electrodes placed near the target nerve. An external transmitter placed over the skin near the the antenna portion delivers electrical pulses to the nerve. The StimQ is MR Conditional at 1.5T, but earlier models (like the Freedom 8A) are MR Unsafe . Internal design of the The StimQ PNS (from Billet under CC BY) MR Conditional StimQ for tibial nerve PNS The StimRouter  PNS system ( Bioness ) is similar to the StimQ in that it consists of a single implanted lead with a stimulation end (placed near the nerve) and a receiver end (placed subcutaneously). A matchbox-sized, battery-operated external pulse transmitter stimulates the lead and subsequently the nerve. The StimRouter is MR Conditional at 1.5T and 3.0T (with the external transmitter removed). The entire device should lie outside the physical limits of the RF transmit coil used (body, head, knee, etc.) MR Conditional Nalu PNS The Nalu System ( Nalumed ) consists of an implanted miniature stimulator whose hairbrush leads are set in close proximity to the target peripheral nerve. The stimulator is inductively powered by a battery-containing therapy disc, which is worn on the skin directly over the implant. The Nalu is MR Conditional (with the external components removed). Special conditions include performing impedance checks before and after scanning, and using exclusively transmit/receive head or extremity coils for imaging. Initially met with skepticism, electrical stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve is now a scientifically proven treatment for overactive bladder. The exact mechanism is unknown, but peripheral electrostimulation apparently disrupts neural pathways of the lower urinary tract and modulates higher spinal or brainstem reflexes for micturition. There is only one implantable tibial nerve stimulator system now manufactured, BlueWind RENOVA (MR Conditional at 1.5T and 3.0T). Another legacy tibial nerve stimulator, the Urgent-SQ , may occasionally be encountered. Both devices include a passive receiver element with electrodes implanted near the tibial nerve and require an additional external pulse generator that sends power and stimuli to the receiver transcutaneously.

When a ferromagnetic material is brought into the presence of a strong external magnetic field, its electron spins in magnetic domains (initially randomly distributed) will begin to align with the field. The domains redefine their walls and grow or shrink to minimize total system energy. As this occurs, the metal develops an internal magnetization (M) that increases until it reaches the saturation point (where all domains are fully aligned). Increasing the external field further has no substantial effect on the material's magnetization. The table below shows the magnetic saturation values for various ferromagnetic metals and alloys. Thus, for example, even when placed in a 7 T external magnetic field, the maximum internal magnetization of an object made of 410 stainless steel can never exceed a value corresponding to 1.3T. Magnetic saturation of a \"virgin\" ferromagnetic material as external applied field is increased. With progressive internal magnetization, the walls of the domains change in addition to rotation of electron spin alignment with the external field. Magnetic saturation ( B sat ) measured in Tesla, by relationship: B sat =  o M s Surprisingly, the strength of the external magnetic field needed to saturate a ferromagnetic object is not necessarily the same as these magnetic saturation values. The example shown above represents a \"virgin\" ferromagnetic material (i.e. one that has never been exposed to a strong magnetic field). The past-magnetic history of the object must be taken into consideration before being able to calculate how it will be affected by a newly applied magnetic field. Additionally, the shape and alignment of the object plays a critical role as well, allowing magnetic saturation to occur at external field levels significantly lower than expected. Magnetic History Hysteresis curve for a soft ferromagnetic material. Remanence is the residual magnetization after the external field has been removed. Coercivity is the amount of field reversal needed to bring the internal magnetization back to zero. Dotted path represents the initial magnetization from the metal's virgin state. When a ferromagnetic object is removed from the external applied field (i.e., taken out of the scanner), it will in general not fully return to its previous unmagnetized state but retain some residual magnetization (known as remanence ). Hard ferromagnetic materials , such as cobalt steel, nickel, and few alloys of cobalt and aluminum, retain appreciable magnetization and are difficult to demagnetize. By contrast, soft ferromagnetic materials, such as cast iron, silicon steel, and nickel-iron alloys (Permalloy, MuMetal), retain only mild residual magnetism and can be easily demagnetized by applying an external field in the opposite direction, the magnitude of which is known as coercivity . The actual ramp up path to full saturation therefore depends on the magnetic history of the metal. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit a so-called hysteresis curve after their initial magnetic field exposure. The hysteresis curve is wide for hard ferromagnetic materials but relatively narrow for soft ferromagnetic materials. Effect of Object Shape The object's shape has a fascinating and unexpected effect on its magnetization due to the presence of internal demagnetizing fields .

The resonance frequency of a particular nucleus is determined not by the strength of the externally applied magnetic field ( B o ), but by the local field ( B loc ) experienced by the nucleus at the atomic level. All H nuclei within a patient therefore do not resonate at precisely the same frequency; differences in resonance frequency (called chemical shifts ) exist depending upon the chemical nature of the molecule in which they reside. For H these shifts are relatively small (on the order of a few hundred Hz at 1.5T) but are detectable. The characterization of compounds based on chemical shifts is the principal subject of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). When placed in an external magnetic field ( B o ) a reactive response of the electron clouds around a nucleus produces an induced field ( B ind ) that typically opposes the applied field. This is called \"shielding\". The resonant frequency of the nucleus depends on B loc = B o  B ind . Chemical shifts result from diamagnetic susceptibility effects at the atomic/molecular level. Susceptibility is a response of matter to an external magnetic field that may arise from several different mechanisms (described in a prior Q&A ). The easiest way to think about the phenomenon is to imagine that the electrons circulating around the nucleus produce an \"induced\" magnetic field ( B ind ) that opposes B o . The electron cloud thus acts as a \"shield\" to protect the nucleus from the full force of B o . The shielding factor is commonly given the symbol  , where B ind =  B o . The local effective field experienced by the nucleus is therefore B loc , where B loc = B o  B ind = B o (1  ) Older literature sometimes referred to  as the \"chemical shift\". This terminology created some confusion in that B ind and B loc are not measured directly. In practice, chemists measure differences in NMR frequencies between a sample under investigation and an external reference standard. In 2001 the International Union of Physicists and Chemists (IUPAC) recommended abandoning the use of  in favor of the -scale , with chemical shift () defined as  = ( f samp  f ref ) / f ref where f samp is the NMR frequency of the nuclear species under investigation and f ref is the NMR frequency of a reference compound. The frequency difference ( f samp  f ref ) is usually on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand Hz, while the reference frequency ( f ref ) is measured in MHz. The chemical shift (  ) is therefore a small number, expressed in units of parts per million (ppm) . The suffix ppm is interchangeable with x10 6 , just as the symbol % is interchangeable with x0.01 or x10 2 . The chemical shift (  ) is a dimensionless constant specific for each type of nucleus (H, P, etc) and chemical configuration (C H 3 , O H , -- P O 4 , etc). Tables of chemical shift values are readily available (now embedded into computer/smart phone applications) allowing chemists rapid identification of detected nuclei in MRS experiments.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/chemical-shift.html"}

At temperatures close to absolute zero, we would indeed predict that the vast majority of spins would have quantum amplitudes vastly favoring the lower energy (\"parallel\") state. At body temperatures, however, this tendency for spins to \"prefer\" the lower energy level is opposed by thermal motions that tend to equalize the two energy levels. The resultant equilibrium distribution is therefore a compromise predicted by the Boltzmann distribution N+/N  = exp [  E / kT ] where N+ and N- represent the number of spins one would expect to measure in the spin-up and spin-down configurations,  E is the difference in energy between the two states, k is the Boltzmann constant (1.381 x 10 -23 joules/K), and T is the absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. At body temperature in a field of 1.0 Tesla, this equation predicts that the N+ and N- are nearly equal; only a small excess (~3 x 10 -6 ) of spins can be expected to be found in the lower energy (spin-up) state when measured. The Boltzmann distribution shows distribution of particle energies as a function of temperature. Near room/body temperatures (300 K red curve) the distribution of low and high energy particles is nearly equal. \"Compasses in a Dryer\" Analogy Another way to think about the distribution of spin states and thermal interactions is using the \"Compasses in a Dryer\" analogy (pictured left). Here individual nuclei are envisioned as small compasses placed in a dryer. Just as nuclei \"prefer\" to point in the direction of the main magnetic field, so the little compasses all try to align along the earth's magnetic field and point to the North Star. The compasses are all constantly being jarred by the tumbling dryer and interact with each other (the equivalent of thermal collisions and spin-spin interactions experienced by nuclei). As such, only a small fraction of the compasses will actually point north. On the average, however, more will point north than any other direction. The net field from all these little compasses summed together is equivalent to the net magnetization vector M . The maximum value of net magnetization at equilibrium along the direction of the main magnetic field ( B o ) is denoted M o . As we will show in later Q&A's, M o determines the maximum amount of signal it is possible to generate from an NMR/MRI experiment. Both classical thermodynamic analysis using the Boltzmann distribution or quantum mechanics provides equivalent estimates for the value of M o M o   h N s B o / 4kT where  is the gyromagnetic ratio, h is Planck's constant, N s is the number of spins, B o is magnetic field strength, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is absolute temperature. The most important practical conclusion that can be drawn from this equation are that Mo is directly proportional to both the number of spins and to magnetic field strength. Thus potential MR signal will be greater for substances with larger numbers of available spins (\"spin densities\") and when performed at higher magnetic fields.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fall-to-lowest-state.html"}

What is causing this? The artifact you are describing is called the Nyquist N/2 Ghost . It occurs with echo-planar imaging sequences that have a zig-zag trajectory through k -space. In head MRI it is sometimes referred to as the \"Three Brains Artifact\". EPI pulse sequences are composed of a train of echoes, one echo generated for each line of k -space traversed. In zig-zag acquisition, every second echo is acquired in an alternate direction. For image reconstruction, even numbered echoes must be time-reversed so that match the odd numbered echoes before Fourier transformation. Nyquist N/2 Ghost Artifact If the forward and backward echoes are not perfect mirror images of each other, then artifacts are introduced into the image processing. Even a simple delay of the start of the first echo will be propagated into all later echoes resulting in slight timing differences between the peaks of odd- and even-numbered echoes. When the Fourier transform is performed, this phase error results in signal intensity displaced in the phase-encode direction halfway across the image. If there are N pixels across the FOV, this aliased ghost appears shifted N/2 pixels relative to the main image positioned at the correct location. Zig-zag k -space trajectory as a cause of Nyquist N/2 ghosts due to slight timing differences between peaks of odd and even echoes. Nyquist ghosts can result from many possible sources including poor shimming, gradient coil heating, patient motion, receiver filter asymmetry, susceptibility, and reconstruction errors. The most common cause, however, is the induction of eddy currents in coils and the magnet housing in response to rapidly changing gradient pulses. These eddy currents, in turn, produce local fields that distort B o and add phase shifts to the data. The even- and odd-numbered lines have oppositely directed readout gradients. This means that alternate lines will have opposite eddy-current-induced phase shifts. Using oblique slices may also contribute to the production of Nyquist N/2 ghosts. Oblique imaging requires simultaneous application of the three physical gradients (G x , G y , and G z ) in various mixtures throughout image acquisition. However, each physical gradient has a unique electrical inductance and responds differently to being switched on and off. If the three gradients do not activate and deactivate at exactly the same time, phase errors may occur. Sometimes simply adjusting slice obliquity (either more or less) will reduce the Nyquist ghosts. Other methods to reduce Nyquist N/2 ghosts include re-shimming, reducing echo train length, lowering the phase-encoding resolution, avoiding multi-shot (segmented) EPI, and employing parallel imaging acceleration. If these methods do not work and the artifact persists over multiple subjects, then more extensive servicing by an engineer to recalibrate the gradients and eddy current compensation may be required.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/nyquist-n2-ghosts.html"}

Radial sampling of k -space data, one of the earliest methods for image reconstruction, was largely supplanted in the 1980's by the \"spin-warp\" technique that employed rectilinear (Cartesian) data acquisition. To this day, Cartesian methods remain dominant, but radial (and spiral) approaches are fast gaining ground. Rectilinear (Cartesian) sampling of k -space Radial sampling of k -space The principal advantage of Cartesian sampling is that the data elements are regularly spaced and can be placed directly into standard array processors designed for efficient Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) computations. Radial methods generate data points that do not fall into a rectangular matrix. To efficiently process such non-uniformly acquired data, these points must be morphed into a Cartesian format, an iterative process commonly referred to as \" gridding \". The major benefit of radial sampling (leading to its now widespread adoption) is relative insensitivity to motion artifacts. Unlike Cartesian methods, radial sampling does not have unique frequency- and phase-encode directions. Noise from moving anatomic structures thus does not propagate as discrete ghosts along a single phase-encode direction, but is distributed more diffusely across the entire image. In radial acquisition the center of k -space is oversampled and continuously updated due to the overlapping \"spokes\" that repeatedly pass through this region. This redundancy can be exploited to detect and correct for movement if the signal from the k -space center changes between views. Additionally, all radial spokes make equal contributions to the image (unlike Cartesian sampling where just a few lines through the center of k -space set overall image contrast and noise levels). So motion on just one or a few radial views is not likely to severely degrade image quality. PROPELLER sequence sampling \"blades\" of data in a rotating fashion around the center of k -space Today's most widely used radial sampling method is GE's PROPELLER ( P eriodically R otated O verlapping P aral EL L ines with E nhanced R econstruction) or one of its variants: Siemens' ( BLADE ), Philips' ( MulitVane ), Hitachi's ( RADAR ), and Canon's ( JET ). Instead of a single radial line, a group of several (typically 8-32) parallel lines (called \"blades\") are collected in a multi-echo acquisition. In clinical practice this is most commonly a 2D Fast/Turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) sequence. The blades are then rotated about 1020 at which time a second set of data are acquired. The process continues until imaging data from the entire k -space circle has been collected. Further information and examples of PROPELLER can be found in this related Q&A . \"Stack of Stars\" Primary radial acquisition by sampling of individual lines (rather than groups/blades) is now offered by at least one major vendor. Siemens' StarVIBE product combines in-plane radial sampling using a fat-suppressd spoiled-GRE core sequence. The process can be extended to 3D, using rectilinear (Cartesian) sampling in the z -direction while maintaining radial sampling in the xy -plane. This 3D implementation is known as Stack of Stars .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/radial-sampling.html"}

Before an MRS study can be performed, the operator must make decisions concerning various imaging parameters, including voxel size, repetition time ( TR ), echo time ( TE ), and number of excitations ( NEX ). These choices involve trade-offs in spatial and spectral resolution, imaging time, and visibility of different metabolites. These concepts will be illustrated using single voxel spectra from the parietal lobe of a normal subject performed with the PRESS technique. Although the results are specific to this technique and brain region, most of the concepts can be generalized to multivoxel imaging and other pulse sequences (STEAM, SE). Voxel Size Voxel size is the primary determinant of signal-to-noise (SNR) in both MRI and MRS. The effect is direct and linear: a voxel twice as large as another will have twice the SNR. In MRS the size of each peak is roughly proportional to the number of protons giving rise to that peak, so if the vertical axis remains a fixed dimension we would expect all peaks to become taller as voxel volume increases. In Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS) the three voxel dimensions are directly specified in mm . In Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) voxel dimensions are more indirectly prescribed. Here the voxel dimension ( d ) in each phase encoding direction equals the field-of-view ( FOV )  the number of phase-encoding steps ( N p ). Number of Excitations (NEX) The number of excitations (NEX) , known on some systems as the number of signals averaged (NSA) , is an important determinant of SNR. For statistical regions discussed in a prior Q&A, SNR is generally proportional to the square root of the number of signals averaged (  NEX ). So if NEX is quadrupled (x4), the SNR is doubled (x2). This can be appreciated in the PRESS spectra below obtained at TR = 1500 and TE = 144 ms. Note that the peaks are sharper and the baseline noise much reduced in the NEX = 256 image compared to the NEX = 8 image. Imaging time is directly proportional to NEX , so even though better quality spectra are obtained by increasing NEX , a time penalty results. To keep imaging times within \"reasonable\" ranges (i.e., 5-15 minutes), typical NEX values might be 1-2 (for 3D-CSI), 2-8 (for 2D-CSI), and 64-128 (for SVS) as an acceptable tradeoff between time and quality. Repetition and Echo Times ( TR & TE ) Just like whole organs, individual brain metabolites have measurable T1 and T2 relaxation times. These differ somewhat by cerebral region, subject age, and field strenth. Average values measured at 3T for several common metabolites are shown in the table (right). As with conventional MR imaging, T2 values define the decay rate of the transverse magnetization. At short TE's (as in the TE = 30 msec spectrum below left), all metabolic peaks will be at their maximum values because they have had little time to undergo T2 decay. Additionally, the damping effects of J -coupling modulations are minimized. Metabolites with short T2 values (like glutamate and choline) will be relatively advantaged. Especially prominent at short TE values are the broad macromolecular peaks producing the prominent undulating baseline. For these multiple reasons a short TE sequence is essential for any brain H MRS study. By comparison, the medium and long TE examples ( TE = 144 and 288 msec) have much more level baselines free of macromolecular undulations. The three major peaks (NAA, Cho, and Cr) are well seen, but the smaller peaks progressively disappear. Lactate, if present, would appear as an inverted doublet on the TE = 144 spectrum but be upright at TE = 288. For most brain studies only the TE = 144 spectrum is obtained. Because of progressive T2 decay, the absolute height of all peaks are reduced with increasing TE , and the noise level is increased. Repetition time ( TR ) controls T1-weighting. When TR is much shorter than the T1 of a metabolite, longitudinal magnetization does not fully recover and the peak height is reduced. (Note how NAA, with its long T1, is relatively short on the TR = 1500 spectrum). Ideally, better spectra would be produced for all metabolites using very long TR values. However, imaging time directly related to TR , so in most cases this penalty is not deemed worth the benefit. In general clinical practice for both SVS and CSI spectroscopy, TR values in the 1500  2000 msec range are typically chosen as a compromise.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/choice-of-trteetc.html"}

In the previous Q&A we introduced the concept of the two nuclear spin states of the H nucleus, commonly denoted as |+ and |-. We also showed how the separation and measurement of such states could be obtained by passing the spins through a magnetic field ( B o ) as Stern and Gerlach did in 1922. Because the spins tend to sort themselves into orientations either generally aligned with or opposed to the external field, the two spin states are often referred to as \" spin-up \" or \" parallel \" and \" spin-down \" or \" anti-parallel \". The physical separation of spin-up and spin-down particles in the Stern-Gerlach apparatus reflects an energy difference (  ) between the two states. This is known as the nuclear Zeeman effect , named after Pieter Zeeman, who in 1896 had observed the splitting of optical spectral lines by a magnetic field. The animated image to the right gives some insight into why the spin-up and spin-down states are separated in energy. In the spin-up state, the detected component of nuclear angular momentum is in the same direction as the external magnetic field. In the spin-down state, it is in the opposite direction. An intuitive model of Zeeman splitting with nuclei as simple bar magnets. On the left no external field is present, so the energy level is the same regardless of nuclear orientation. On the right the nucleus has been placed in an external magnetic field. There is a low-energy state and a high-energy state depending on orientation with or against the field. Our experience in the macroscopic world informs us that physical energy is required to to push the like poles of two bar magnets close together. Their natural (and lower energy) state is to be in parallel, not in opposition. By analogy, the lower energy state for a nuclear spin in an external field is spin-up/parallel, while the higher energy state is spin-down/anti-parallel. Warning: Although we have described two pure states for the nucleus (spin-up and spin-down), it is incorrect to infer that spins physically reside only in one of these two states or that they \"flip\" from one state to another. See the next Q&A for a more complete discussion. In the subatomic world governed by quantum mechanics, not only spin angular momentum but also the transfer of energy may assume only discrete units. In 1905 Max Planck showed the relationship between the change in energy ( E ) of an atomic system by emission of a photon of frequency ( f o ) to be:  E = h f o where h is Planck's constant whose value is approximately 6.626 x 10 -34 Joule-sec. Planck's constant reflects the granularity of the subatomic world and the fact that energy is released or absorbed only in discrete packets or quanta . The energy gap (  ) between two nuclear spin states scales directly with magnetic field strength and is given by the Zeeman equation:   =  h B o where  is called the gyromagnetic ratio , a constant specific to a particular nucleus. For the H nucleus, the value of  is 42.58 MHz/Tesla. The Planck relation and Zeeman equation may be combined, producing an interesting and important result that will look familiar to those with prior exposure to MRI: Nuclear Zeeman splitting. The energy gap (E) between spin-up |+ and spin-down |  states is directly proportional to the magnetic field strength (Bo). E = h f o =  h B o or f o =  B o This is the famous Larmor equation , showing that NMR resonance frequency ( f o ) is simply the gyromagnetic ratio (  ) times the magnetic field strength ( B o ). Of course, this is not a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics, but does show how directly the Larmor relation results from very basic concepts that should be understandable to most readers. The fact that Planck's constant ( h ) disappears from the solution implies that a non-quantum explanation using classical physics is also possible. If you don't understand everything right now, don't worry. We will have much, more more to say about the Larmor equation in later Q&A's!", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/energy-splitting.html"}

Any periodically oscillating sinusoidal wave (or simple MR signal) has three fundamental properties: amplitude, frequency, and phase. These properties are explicitly apparent in the mathematical formulation for a sine wave: S ( t ) = A sin(  o t  ) where S ( t ) is the signal as a function of time, A is the amplitude,  o is the angular frequency, and  is the instantaneous phase. By adjusting these factors, the appearance of the sine wave can be varied. Instantaneous phase (  ) represents an angular shift between two sine waves and is measured in radians (or degrees). A sine wave and a cosine wave are 90  (  /2 radians) out of phase with each other. After a period of time, t, two sine waves initially synchronized in phase but differing in frequency by  radians per second will develop a differential total phase shift () given by:  =   t. Or in more general terms expressed by calculus:  =  (t) dt where  is the total phase shift accumulated over a period of time (t) and  ( t ) is the frequency shift that may vary as a function of time. The total accumulated phase shift () can be thought of as the area under a frequency vs time curve. This fact will prove useful when we discuss the phase changes induced by gradients or flow in later Q&A's. If you still don't quite understand why (frequency x time) is phase, think about the units of measurement. Frequency is commonly measured in Hertz, or cycles per second. Time is measured in seconds. So frequency x time = (cycles/sec) x sec = # of cycles. Thus two sine waves differing in frequency by 200 Hz get progressively out of phase with each other by 200 cycles every second. To understand the more complex aspects of frequency and phase encoding of the MR image, it is necessary to review what happens when two sine waves are added together. If two sine waves have the same frequency but different phases, their summation is another sine wave with the same base frequency but a different amplitude and phase. When the two waves are perfectly in phase with each other, their signals augment each other. When they are slightly out of phase with each other, the overall signal is diminished, and they are said to destructively interfere. When the phase shift between them reaches 180, the two waves exactly cancel each other. Summation of two sine waves of the same frequency but different phases. As   180 (out-of-phase condition) the two waves destructively interfere, yielding a net signal that is nearly zero. (Click on image to animate.

Navigators are extra RF-pulses (with echoes) integrated into routine imaging sequences. By measuring the phase shift of navigator echoes, the positions of moving organs or structures can be monitored continuously during MR image acquisition. Navigator pulses are typically applied so as to excite 1-dimensional beams or 2-dimensional planes of tissue. Although navigators may be placed over the heart directly, more commonly they are placed to intersect the right hemidiaphragm at its dome. Knowing the superior-inferior (SI) position of the diaphragm, the heart position can be indirectly calculated. Navigator band placed over right hemidiaphragm. M-mode display of navigator data showing motion of liver (lower gray bands) with respiration. Dark area is lung. The echo signal returned by the navigator is reconstructed in the readout (motion) direction and displayed as lines of data along the beam direction. This technique is a form of line-scan imaging . It is also known as M-mode display since is equivalent to that used for viewing valve motion in M-mode echocardiography. Automated software detects the diaphragmatic peaks and troughs of motion. The MR technologist defines an acceptance (gating) window that is typically on the order of  2.5 mm. The larger the window, the more time for image acquisition, but at the price of increased motion artifacts. The term navigator efficiency refers to the percentage of heartbeats over which data is acquired and is usually in the range of 30-50%. In their simplest implementation described above, navigator echoes serve only as respiratory gating method. In a more advanced implementation ( prospective adaptive motion correction ) navigators can dynamically redefine the position of the imaging volume based on diaphragmatic position. The relationship is somewhat complex in that rotation and translation of the heart do not occur exactly in a 1:1 concordance with the diaphragm. Change in heart position between expiration and inspiration Empiric compensation factors have therefore been established to estimate cardiac motion as a function of diaphragm position. In the SI direction in normal-sized adults, for example, 10 mm of diaphragm movement translates to about 6 mm of movement of the superior margin of the heart, about 7 mm for the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, and about 8 mm for the cardiac apex. The anterior-posterior (AP) movement of these structures is smaller and less variable, typically only about 2 mm for every 10 mm of diaphragm excursion. Left-to-right cardiac displacement with respiration is usually minimal and typically disregarded. Although generic correction factors may be used, better results are obtained on a patient-by-patient basis.

The fringe field is reduced in size by a process called magnetic shielding . Magnetic shielding may be either passive or active. In the early 1980's MR scanners were generally unshielded and magnet rooms was made extremely large (2-4 times the size of modern rooms) to accommodate the large fringe fields. Where required external magnetic fields were constrained using passive shielding methods. In passive shielding iron beams or steel plates are incorporated into the walls, ceiling, and/or floor of the magnet room. These materials concentrate magnetic flux lines close to the scanner. In some cases passive shielding material is applied directly to the outer surfaces of the cryostat or magnet shell. Passive shielding adds considerable weight and expense to MR siting and creates difficulties in achieving high homogeneity within the magnet bore itself. To overcome these limitations, actively shielded magnets were developed in the early 1990's and have now become standard on all superconducting clinical scanners. Occasionally passive shielding is still required, but the amount of steel is significantly less than it would be otherwise. Although a number of 7.0 T magnets also have active shielding, additional passive shielding is usually required due to the very high fields involved. Main and shielding coils of a superconducting magnet before being enclosed in a cryostat. The two coil sets are electrically connected oppositely in series and thus have fields pointing in opposite directions. For example, the main windings might generate a magnetic field of 2.0 T while the shielding coils generate a field of 0.5 T in the opposite direction. The net effect is a magnetic field of 1.5 T in the center of the magnet. Although the usable field strength in the operating volume is reduced by the active shielding, the reduction effect on the fringe field is substantially greater. In active shielding , the fringe fields are suppressed within the cryostat itself rather than contained by ferromagnetic materials outside the scanner. An actively shielded magnet design incorporates at least one additional set of superconductive windings (shield coils) that oppose a portion of the external field generated by the main windings. These secondary shield coil windings are co-axial with the main windings and external to them, as shown in the image left and diagram below. Active shield coils (blue) are in series with the main magnet windings (orange) but carry current in the opposite direction.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-to-reduce-fringe.html"}

A homework problem often assigned in college physics courses is to compute the local magnetic field at a distance ( r ) and angle (  ) from from a magnetic dipole source (). The full derivation is in a reference below, but here is the result for the z-component: This equation shows the expected dependence on the strength of the dipole () and inversely with the third power of distance (1/r). What may be a little surprising is the angular dependence given by the term (3 cos   1). It is fairly easy to see from the diagram above that the z -component of the dipolar field ( B z ) would be maximally positive directly in front of the dipole and maximally negative immediately to either side. Somewhere between these positive and negative \"lobes\" B z must pass through zero. This occurs at angles  m where (3 cos  m  1) = 0. These  m values are known as the magic angles . They occur at approximately 54.7, 125.3 (=18054.7), and so forth around the circle. When two nuclei interact through a dipole-dipole mechanism, the z -component of the dipolar field from one nucleus alters the local field experienced by the second nucleus. In other words, B z adds or subtracts to the B o field experienced by the other nucleus, causing it to precess slightly faster or slower than it otherwise would. As a result, the second nucleus gains or loses phase and undergoes T2 relaxation. This effect is particularly strong when molecular motion is slow and the B z field is relatively static. Dipolar interaction as a function of angle between spins. In a clinical MRI context this can be viewed as 1/T2 vs tendon orientation relative to B o . When the arrangement of the two nuclei approach the magic angle, the effect of B z is minimized and the T2 value is increased. As shown in the graph (left), this angular dependence changes gradually over a wide range of angles rather than dropping off precipitously at the magic angle. The dipolar interaction does not return to normal at 90 because of the combined effects of the \"dips\" at 54.7 and 125.3. The magic angle effect is important in the clinical MR imaging of certain tissues that are highly structured and are oriented obliquely to the main magnetic field (especially tendons, cartilage, and peripheral nerves). The MR signal may spuriously increase near the magic angle mimicking pathology. Due to their dense molecular structure and strong static dipolar interactions, tendons possess short intrinsic T2 values (1-10 ms). The signal of tendons is uniformly low on all conventional MR sequences due to this rapid T2 decay. When oriented at the magic angle, however, the T2 of tendons rises to about 20 ms with a corresponding increase in their signal intensity. Although the magic angle phenomenon affects T2 relaxation (not T1), the increase in signal intensity of tendons will only be appreciated if TE is kept reasonably short. When TE exceeds 40 ms the tendon signal will again be so low that the T2 prolongation will not be recognized. Paradoxically, therefore, the magic angle phenomenon in tendons will be most noticeable on T1- and proton-density-weighted images (using short of medium TE's ) than on heavily T2-weighted sequences (with long TE's ). A basic science application of this phenomenon is known as Magic angle spinning (MAS) , a technique used in solid-state MR spectroscopy laboratories. The sample is placed in an air-turbine device angled 54.7 with respect to the main magnetic field and spun at rates up to 70 kHz. The angulation and spinning averages out the dipole-dipole couplings to zero allowing better appreciation of features of the NMR spectrum (such as secondary quadripolar couplings and chemical shift anisotropies) for determining molecular structures.

Yes, it is indeed possible to use a single composite RF-pulse to excite several slices at once, which are then unaliased during image reconstruction. Most manufacturers offer such an option under different names: POMP (GE), Simultaneous excitation (Siemens), Multi-slice (Philips), Dual-slice (Hitachi), and QuadScan (Canon). Newer methods applicable to multicoil arrays include the MultiBand (MB) technique, described in a later Q&A . In all these methods an initial complex RF-pulse simultaneously stimulate two or more slices that are encoded using a binary (Hadamard) scheme or view-dependent phase modulatation. The oldest commercial version is GE's POMP (\"Phase-Offset MultiPlanar\") technique, illustrated below. Here the RF- pulse is a multiplex of the individual RF-pulses needed to stimulate each of the two slices, phase shifted from each other so that the resulting images do not overlap. Phase-offset multiplanar (POMP) imaging. A complex RF-pulse simultaneously stimulates two slices, which are phase offset from one another by an amount that depends on the phase-encoding step (here 180) To distinguish between signal components from each of the two excited slices, the FOV in the phase-encoding direction must be doubled. This process is similar to that used in the no-phase-wrap technique. To preserve imaging time and SNR, the number of excitations is cut in half. The resultant data set then contains two images with the desired spatial resolution. The phase offset for the images and composite RF pulses will vary with the phase-encode step. At step 1, for example, the first image is phase encoded over a range of 0 to 180, whereas the second image is encoded over a range of 180 to 360. Despite these theoretical advantages, POMP and other simultaneous multi-slice excitation schemes are hampered because noise and phase-encoding artifacts (e.g., flow, wrap-around) may be propagated from one image to the other. Furthermore, because they cannot be used in conjunction with a no-phase-wrap option, they can only be applied in situations when the imaged object does not exceed the FOV in the phase-encode direction. Many of these limitations have been eliminated through the use of multi-coil receiver arrays and parallel imaging. Specifically, the relatively new MultiBand (MB) technique, described in the next Q&A , does precisely that.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/two-slices-at-once.html"}

The chemical shift artifact of the second kind is sometimes known as the India Ink or black line artifact because it looks like organs and muscle bundles have been outlined with a black pen. The line does not correspond to a true anatomic structure, but results from destructive interference of signals within boundary pixels that contain both water and fat. For this reason it is sometimes often called the phase cancellation artifact . Examples in the spine, thigh, and abdomen are shown. This form of chemical shift artifact occurs exclusively in gradient echo imaging (unlike chemical shift artifact of the first kind that is seen in spin echo imaging). Additionally, since this 2nd type of artifact is due to a phase-cancellation effect, it is not limited to the frequency-encode direction (as is the chemical-shift artifact of the first kind), but may be seen in all pixels along a fat-water interface. In spin-echo imaging, the signals between water and fat come back into phase at the center of every echo (even though they differ in frequency and are spatially misregistered). In gradient-echo imaging, however, water and fat protons do not generally come into phase coherence at the center of the echo (since the GRE sequence lacks the 180 refocusing pulse, which accomplishes this task in SE imaging). In a GRE sequence, therefore, fat and water protons go in and out of phase with one another as a function of echo time ( TE ). At 1.5 T the period of this alternation is about 1/(225 Hz) or 4.4 msec. Therefore, at TE = 2.2, 6.6, 11.0, and 15.4 msec, etc., fat and water fall out of phase with one another in gradient-echo images at 1.5 T. GRE images acquired with echo times near these \"special values\" demonstrate chemical-shift artifacts of the second kind. The origin of the phase-cancellation effect and production of the \"black line\" is shown in the diagram above. Here a boundary pixel is illustrated that contains equal numbers of fat and water protons imaged at the out-of-phase time of TE = 2.2 msec. Because the water and fat signals are out of phase, they cancel each other producing zero net magnitude and hence a signal void. Pure fat and pure water pixels have no such cancellation, and because magnitude image reconstruction is displayed, both are rendered bright in the final image. Thus the pure water and fat pixels are separated by a dark boundary at their interface.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/chemical-shift-2nd-kind.html"}

T2-blackout is the opposite of the T2-shine-through phenomenon, described more completely in a prior Q&A . In T2-blackout, lesions with very short T2 (or T2*) values reduce signal intensity in the DW image, potentially masking or destroying its diffusion sensitivity. In extreme cases even the ADC map calculation will be affected and unreliable. An example of T2-blackout is shown below for a subacute hematoma. The T2*-weighted b0 image has extremely low signal due to the paramagnetic effects of intracellular deoxyhemoglobin. The trace DW image also has a dark center, but this is primarily due to blackout from the T2 (T2*) effects. The ADC map shows a scattered mix of bright and dark pixels within the hematoma, demonstrating the computational hazards of estimating ADC values in such situations. T2*-weighted b0 image Trace DW image ADC map The reason both T2-shine-through and T2-blackout occur relate to the nature of the DW (trace) image. By definition the DW image is diffusion - weighted , not a map of diffusion. The DW image is strongly dependent on diffusion, but also reflects underlying T2, spin-density, and T1 effects. When the intrinsic T2 of a lesion is long, T2 effects may spill over into the DW image, making it appear bright and thus mimicking restricted diffusion (\"T2-shine-through\").

FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition) is the GE name for a balanced steady-state gradient echo sequence that Siemens calls TrueFISP and Philips calls balanced-FFE . As described in a prior Q&A , these sequences may be affected by phase shift errors across the image that produce banding artifacts. Such artifacts are particularly prominent at the skull base and other locations where there are susceptibility distortions of the main magnetic field. They are also more problematic in 3D acquisitions where TR values may exceed 10-15 msec. FIESTA-C is a modification of the basic FIESTA/TrueFISP sequence. The equivalent Siemens product is called CISS (Constructive Interference Steady State). FIESTA-C/CISS is composed of a pair of TrueFISP acquisitions run back-to-back preceded by an automatic shimming procedure. The first uses phase alternation of the RF-pulses (+, , +, , ...) while the second does not (+, +, +, etc). When the paired data sets are combined in maximum intensity projection, the phase errors cancel, resulting in an image largely free of dispersion banding.

Ferritin is the principal iron storage molecule found in animal cells. It is a globular protein complex about 10 nm in diameter composed of 24 subunits arranged as a hollow shell ( apoferritin ) in which iron atoms can be packed. A typical ferritin molecule contains about 2000 iron atoms at its core, but potentially may hold up to 4500. Pores are present on the surface of the complex allowing iron atoms to enter and be released from the core. In this manner ferritin is able to regulate levels of intracellular iron. Ferritin is a hollow protein shell composed of 24 subunits. Two subunits have been removed to allow visualization within the core where up to 4500 iron atoms can be stored. Ferritin particle seen under electron microscopy Each iron atom in ferritin has 3 unpaired electrons. When placed in an external magnetic field, spins from these thousands of electrons lock together through a quantum process known as exchange coupling . The ferritin core acts as a solid piece of metal with a single magnetic domain, a phenomenon called superparamagnetism . Dark hemosiderin granules in Kupffer liver cells (Prussian blue stain) Hemosiderin , in contrast to ferritin, is an amorphous iron-containing substance with no fixed composition. It consists of conglomerates of clumped ferritin particles, denatured proteins, and lipids. The iron within hemosiderin is insoluble, but is in equilibrium with the soluble ferritin pool.

Because the spoiled-GRE technique is specifically designed to disrupt transverse (T2) coherences, its major benefit and use is in producing T1-weighted images. Nevertheless, both spin density- and T2*-weighting can be achieved by appropriate selection of parameters. As a result of this versatility and the ability to acquire images in either 2D or 3D modes, spoiled-GRE sequences are now ubiquitously used for MR imaging of virtually every body part. T1-weighted spoiled-GRE TR short (<10 ms) TE short (< 5 ms) Flip angle () large (30-50) T2*-weighted spoiled-GRE TR long (>300 ms) TE relatively long (<20-50 ms) Flip angle () small (5-15) The signal from a spoiled-GRE sequenced depends on three operator-selectable parameters ( TR , TE , and flip angle  ) plus three intrinsic tissue parameters (T1, T2*, and spin-density [H]). Note that dependence is on T2* rather than T2 because SE/STE formation is suppressed by spoiling and the signal is generated by gradient refocusing of an FID. Assuming a longitudinal steady-state has been reached and perfect spoiling, the signal ( S ) of a spoiled GRE sequence is given by where k is a scaling factor. By simple calculus (setting dS/d = 0) we find that the the signal is maximized when  =  E , the Ernst angle , where The Ernst angle concept has already been introduced in a previous Q&A to which the reader is referred for more details. It should be noted that although the Ernst angle gives the highest signal for a given tissue for a certain TR/T1 combination, it does not necessarily maximize image contrast between two different tissues. Carefully dissecting the signal equation provides insight into parameter weighting. Specifically, Click to enlarge (1) Signal is always proportional to spin density [H] , an effect that can never be removed. (2) TE controls T2*-weighting . The only place T2* appears in the equation is in the final term [exp ( TE /T2*)]. When TE is large, this term dominates. When TE is small, this term approaches unity and the T2* contribution is minimized. (3) Flip angle (  ) controls T1-weighting . A small flip angle minimizes T1-weighting because the longitudinal magnetizations of various tissues are not differentiated much by such a small angular displacement. Hence at small flip angles, [H] and T2* effects predominate. Conversely, as   90, T1-weighting increases. (4) TR controls T1-weighting . Note that all occurrences of TR in the equation are in terms of the form [exp ( TR /T1)]. When TR is small, this term becomes large and T1-weighting increases. Conversely, when TR is long, T1-weighting is minimized. The effects of TE ,  , and TR on image contrast are summarized in the images montages below: Effect of TE TE controls T2*-weighting T2*-weighting increases as TE is prolonged. This is because a longer TE allows more time for dephasing before echo formation. Effect of Flip Angle (  )  controls T1-weighting A small flip angle (  ) minimizes T1-weighting. This is because a small flip angle only changes the steady-state longitudinal magnetization of various tissues slightly. Hence they are only slightly differentiated based on their intrinsic T1 properties. So at low flip angles, [H] and T2* effects predominate. Conversely, as   90, T1-weighting increases. Effect of TR TR controls T1-weighting Short TRs accentuate T1 effects. Long TRs minimize T1 effects, allowing [H]-and T2*-weighting to become dominant.

At present there is no comprehensive theory that allows one to reliably predict the exact T1 and T2 values of different tissues. Sophisticated theories have been developed which adequately explain the relaxation properties of simple solutions and homogeneous preparations of macromolecules. However, tissues are extraordinarily complex, containing a wide variety of different molecules and possessing structure at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. Even water is not simple to analyze in tissues; it may exist in multiple states, ranging from free (unbound) to partially structured to fully bound. The relaxation properties of most tissues can be explained as in terms of 2- or 3-compartment models, after various assumptions are made regarding exchange rates, water fractions, and the like. One of the oldest and best known of these, first proposed in 1957, is the fast exchange model of Zimmerman and Brittin. A more modern multicompartment model is illustrated in the figure right, which shows different contributions to T1 and T2. It should be kept in mind that all such models are only crude approximations of \"reality\", and it is possible to construct many equivalent models. To predict the relative T1 and T2 values of different tissues and to explain their general appearance at MR imaging, it must first be decided whether the observed signal comes principally from lipid or water protons. For most tissues, water protons generate most (if not all) of the MR signal. In fact, both T1 and T2 values correlate most powerfully and simply with the bulk water content of a tissue. As a rule, the \"squishier\" or \"juicier\" a tissue, the longer will be its T1 and T2 values. For example, this principle may be used to predict (and remember) that the T1 and T2 values of the renal medulla (where the urine collects) are longer than those of the renal cortex; the spleen (with more blood) has longer T1 and T2 than the liver, and so forth. Although this \"squishiness\" concept should be considered purely a mnemonic device and one for which exceptions can easily be found, it has nevertheless served me well over the last several years. In fact, using this crude concept as a starting point, many years ago I was able to show (after rigorous, double blind, radiologic-pathologic correlation, of course) why some meningiomas are dark and others are bright on MR images. Although in most tissues bulk water content is a strong predictor of T1 and T2, in other tissues the contribution of aliphatic lipid protons to the MR signal must be considered. These nonpolar storage fats have short T1 values, but relatively long T2 values (as they are intermediate in size, their motions are close to the Larmor frequency and there are few static contributions to allow T2 dephasing.) In adipose tissue, for example, nearly all the MR signal arises from such lipid protons. In other tissues, such as bone marrow, liver, and skeletal muscle, fat and water protons each make significant contributions to the total signal and net relaxation times. Here careful measurements will actually reveal multicomponent contributions to both T1 and T2.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-to-predict-t1--t2.html"}

Point RESolved Spectroscopy (PRESS) is the dominant method used for H spectroscopy at 1.5T and 3.0T . The core sequence consists of three slice-selective RF-pulses (9018 018 0 ) applied concurrently with three orthogonal gradients ( x , y and z). The PRESS signal at time TE is a spin echo derived only from protons that have experienced all 3 RF-pulses. These protons are located in a cuboid-shaped voxel where the three imaging planes overlap. Simplified diagram of the PRESS SVS sequence for MRS. Methods for water and fat suppression are described in separate Q&A's. The PRESS sequence is relatively easy to program and implement. It is not restricted to single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) but can be used with phase-encoding gradients in chemical shift imaging (CSI) allowing subdivision into multiple smaller voxels. The main disadvantage of PRESS is limitation of its minimum achievable TE. In practice, TE's of 30-35 msec are commonly used, and values below 25 msec are difficult to attain. The relatively high minimum TE directly follows from the pulse sequence structure -- multiple RF-pulses and waiting for spin-echoes takes time! The practical implication is that metabolites with short T2's will be difficult to resolve using PRESS. Thus PRESS cannot be used for P spectroscopy at all (where all the relevant metabolites have very short T2s). And since T2 values decrease with increasing field strength, PRESS is less useful even for H spectroscopy at 7T and above. A final minor limitation of PRESS is the potential for tissue heating. The multiple 18 0 -pulses deposit considerable energy, and in some instances specific absorption rate (SAR) limits may be exceeded. In these cases the less commonly used STimulated Echo Acquisition Mode (STEAM) method may offer lower energy deposition (as well as shorter TE's ) than PRESS and be preferred.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/press.html"}

Brightly colored \" blobs \" on fMRI maps represent brain regions or voxels where \"statistically significant\" levels of activation or correlation are thought to have occurred. The size and number of these blobs are somewhat arbitrarily chosen, however, involving tradeoffs between excluding false positives (saying an area activates when it does not) and accepting false negatives (considering an area to be silent when it really does activate). The first level coloring decision is typically based on calculation of a so-called test statistic (e.g., a T- , F - or Z -score) for each voxel or brain region from the fMRI data . Under the null hypothesis that no true activation has occurred, a p-value can be determined, representing the probability that the calculated test statistic score or larger has occurred by chance. Whenever the p- value is less than an arbitrary preselected level of significance, we conclude the measurement is unlikely to have occurred by chance and classify the voxel as \"activated/correlated\".

Sequences for cardiac perfusion are have some unique features described in a prior Q&A . A typical pulse sequence used for brain, breast, or prostate DCE at 1.5 T might be prescribed using the following parameters: Sequence (3D SPGR or FLASH), TR = 4-6 ms, TE = 1-3 ms, flip angle = 10-15, and parallel acceleration factor = 2. The field-of-view, slice thickness, number of slices, and imaging matrix are determined by the application. Breast and prostate DCE studies are often used to characterize small lesions, so for these studies slice thicknesses of  3 mm and in-plane pixel sizes  1 mm are generally required. Brain DCE may not mandate such rigorous spatial resolution, with slice thicknesses as large as 5 mm and pixel sizes up to 50% larger allowed.

Similar sequences offered by the major manufacturers include LAVA (GE), VIBE (Siemens), THRIVE (Philips), and TIGRE (Hitachi). The temporal resolution of these sequences is on the order of 15-20 seconds, which is acceptable for many but not all applications. More highly accelerated DCE acquisition schemes based on k -space segmentation and random sampling similar to those used in MR angiography (e.g. DISCO ) have been used. Parallel imaging methods such as CAIPIRINHA are also becoming popular. Compressed Sensing (CS) methods such as kt -techniques based on sparse sampling also show great promise for DCE applications. For breast MR where only semi-quantitative DCE analysis is to be performed, images are typically generated about every 12 minutes and continue for 57 minutes. Because prostate neoplasms typically have faster uptake and washout of contrast than breast tumors, the temporal resolution for prostate DCE is more demanding  images must obtained at least every 10 seconds and continue for up to 5 minutes post injection. Brain DCE imaging is often performed with the intent of generating tissue perfusion parameters based on pharmacokinetic modeling. Such a complete quantitative analysis typically requires an additional pre-contrast T1 mapping protocol that may be either a single Look-Locker type sequence ( see related Q&A ) or a series of volume acquisitions with different flip angles and echo times. Once T1 mapping has been performed, a spoiled 3D GRE sequence similar to those above is run with temporal resolution in the 5 sec range with collection of data for at least 5 minutes.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-is-dce-performed.html"}

In the 1990s the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) jointly worked to develop the first international standards for MR equipment safety, codified as IEC 60601-2-33. This document recognized three modes of scanner operation based on perceived risk to patients and volunteers: Normal operating mode . This is the \"routine\" level at which most clinical MRI today is performed, being considered safe for all patients, regardless of their condition. First level controlled operating mode . This level is defined as one where certain imaging parameters may cause physiologic stress (such as peripheral nerve stimulation or tissue heating). Active medical supervision is required to use this mode to insure that a careful assessment of benefits vs risks have been assessed. The FDA requires equipment operating in this mode to display and record dB/dt and SAR levels, and display a warning that the first level mode is about to be reached. The MR scan operator must acknowledge this at the console before being allowed to proceed with the scan. Second level controlled operating mode . Also called \"research\" or experimental\" mode, this level is reached when such operation may produce significant risks to patients. Second level mode may only be used under an appropriate ethics/human studies protocol. Special security measures (such as software password lock) must be used to prevent unauthorized operation in this mode. The original IEC definitions continue to be refined, and several other national and international organizations, including the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) , have adopted similar operating mode categories. The basic parameters defining each mode include static field ( B o ), time-varying gradients ( dB/dt ), specific absorption rate (SAR) by body part, and temperature rise. Cutoff values for each can be found in the references below. IEC SAR Limits . For convenience these have been repeated from the prior Q&A . IEC SAR Limits (W/kg) .All values are based on the environmental temperature being  25C. For higher temperatures, the First Level whole body limit (4 W/kg) only is derated by 0.25 W/kg for each 1 C rise until the Normal operating level limit (2 W/kg) is reached. Partial body limits are scaled according to Mass Ratio (R) = RF-exposed patient mass  total patient mass, giving ranges: a = [10  8R] W/kg and b = [10  6R] W/kg. Transmit/receive knee and wrist coils are covered under the \"partial body\" limits. IEC Tissue Temperature Limits . Maximum allowable core and local temperatures are 39 C and 40 C for both Normal and First Level operating modes. There are also restrictions on the rise of core temperature, limited to 0.5 C for Normal mode and 1 C for First Level mode. As before, the local IRB is responsible for setting Second Level temperature limits. Main Magnetic Field Strength ( B o ) . The IEC has established the following operating mode limits based on field strength: Normal mode ( 3.0T), First Level controlled mode ( 8.0T), and Second Level Mode (> 8.0T but below IRB limit). Gradient Output Limits ( dB/dt ) . The IEC has set limits for the effects of gradient switching based upon observed or theoretical levels of peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) .

STIR stands for S hort- T I I nversion R ecovery and is typically used to null the signal from fat. At 1.5T fat has a T1 value of approximately 260 ms, so its TI null value is approximately 0.69 x 250 = 180 ms. The optimal value is often slightly less than this for two reasons: 1) adipose tissues contain variable amounts of water, and 2) a fast spin echo signal acquisition method is commonly used which includes the application of additional 180 -pulses and gradients. As such typical practical values of TI for STIR at 1.5T are in the 160-180 range. The fat suppression possible by STIR is generally uniform and relatively independent of both B o and B 1 inhomogeneities. STIR may be superior to other fat saturation methods (such as spectral \"fat-sat\") especially near metallic foreign bodies, near tissue interfaces with high susceptibility differences (like the skull base/sinuses), and across large body parts (such as the abdomen and pelvis). It is even possible to perform whole-body STIR imaging as a screening technique for bone metastases. In lower field permanent magnet scanners with relatively poor homogeneity, STIR is one of the only fat suppression methods available. STIR image with excellent fat suppression, allowing optic neuritis to be well seen. STIR (as well as other short and medium-TI sequences) has an additional useful feature  additive T1+T2 contrast. In routine SE imaging lesions with prolonged T1 and T2 have competitive effects on signal intensity (T1 reduces signal while T2 increases signal). In STIR imaging the effects of T1 and T2 are additive. This results from the fact that the longitudinal magnetization of long T1 lesions on STIR remain inverted and produce a high signal as shown below. At short to medium TIs, long T1 substances (such as CSF) are bright on magnitude IR. This is opposite to SE where long T1 values cause reduced signal intensity. Additive T1 and T2 effects. MS plaque seen better on STIR image (right) than SE image (left) In spite of these advantages, STIR does have some limitations: STIR cannot be used as a fat suppression technique post-gadolinium. STIR does not specifically suppress fat; it only suppresses tissues with T1 values in the range of fat (200-300 ms). Thus gadolinium-containing tissues with similar relaxation times will also be suppressed. Proteinaceous and other short T1 materials will also be suppressed. Although contrast-to-noise for certain lesions may be improved, overall signal-to-noise may be poor.

In routine MR imaging, a pixel is spatially encoded by both phase and frequency. This process is not instantaneous, and in general, phase encoding is performed first. If a spin moves between the times of phase encoding and frequency encoding, its apparent position in the image will be artifactually displaced from its true position. This phenomenon is shown in the image right. Spatial misregistration of flow is most prominent for vessels lying within the plane of imaging. It is accentuated by increased TE (since this increases the interval between phase-encoding and frequency readout). It is also prominent on GRE images as well as any sequence where gradient moment nulling has been used. Spatial flow misregistration with refocusing of intravascular signal (yellow arrows) relative to the flow voids in the actual vessels (blue arrows). Here the frequency-encoding direction is from top to bottom of the image. Spatial misregistration of flow occurs because PE and FE are performed at different times. A spin at point (1) is first encoded to phase position (p). If the spin flows to point (2) it will be frequency encoded to position (f). The final mapping to point (p,f) will be spatially misregistered relative to the true vascular position. Direction of flow can be predicted from MR image by noticing the position of the spatially misregistration with respect to the frequency-encode direction. The misregistered signal will be displaced to the side of the vessel having a vector component of flow in the FE direction. For most sequences it is possible to predict the direction of flow when a flow-misregistration artifact is noted. One simply looks to see on which side of the vessel the artifact appears in relation to the frequency-encode axis. The artifact will lie on the side of the vessel where there is a vector component of flow. From this information the flow direction can be predicted in most cases. One should be cautioned, however, that when certain gradient structures or imaging techniques are used, this appearance may be reversed. Notwithstanding this limitation, the flow displacement artifact sign may be useful in routine imaging, particularly when a vascular malformation is encountered.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/flow-misregistration.html"}

An artificial neural network (AAN) is a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. It consists of a set of interconnected processing nodes ( artificial neurons ), organized into layers that work together. The initial layer receives input data and the final layer produces the output. In between the input and output layers are one or more hidden layers. The hidden layers perform a series of nonlinear transformations on the input data, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in the data. AANs with just a small number (1-3) hidden layers are known as shallow networks ; those with many more layers are called deep networks . Upper image: columns of neurons in the cerebral cortex drawn by 1906 Nobel laureate Santiago Ramn y Cajal. Lower image: a fully connected artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers, crudely resembling the biologic specimen. The fundamental component of artificial neural networks, loosely modeled after biological nerve cells, is called the perceptron , alternatively known as an ( artificial ) neuron , unit, or node . In network diagrams like the one above, individual neurons are represented by colored circles. Biologic and artificial neurons A biological nerve cell receives input stimuli from neighboring nerves through its dendrites . If the sum of these stimuli is sufficient to create membrane depolarization in the neuron's cell body , an electrical output signal will be transmitted down the axon to its terminals ( which in turn may stimulate dendrites of other nerves). The artificial neuron receives a set of weighted inputs ( w 1 x 1 + w 2 x 2 +  + w n x n ) plus a constant bias (B) . This weighted sum is then fed into an activation function that produces an output for the node. Common activation functions: Logistic sigmoid = 1/(1+e x ) and ReLU = max(0,x) The purpose of the activation function is to introduce nonlinearities between units. Without this, the output of all neuron groups would simply be linear combinations of the others and the more interesting and powerful behaviors of neural networks would not be possible. The most common forms of activation functions are steps, ramps, and sigmoids . The most widely used is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) function that allows only positive sums to pass through. The logistic sigmoid function, popular in the past, has fallen out of favor because of its saturation at larger input values. A dozen examples of commonly used activation functions in graphical format can be seen here . Usually the same activation function is used for all nodes of a network, except for the final output node(s). The AAN diagram above constitutes a simple feed forward network , where the outputs of nodes from one layer become inputs for the next layer. Furthermore, the output of every node passes to every node in the next layer, making this a fully connected network . However, many other configurations are possible. For example, the output of one node may pass back to itself (a recurrent network ) or other nodes in the same layer. Alternatively, the output from one node may skip one or more layers or pass to nodes in multiple layers (a dense network ).

I would consider excellent field homogeneity to be one of the most important criteria in selecting a magnet for imaging. Magnet homogeneity directly relates to image quality and various artifacts. The types of problems associated with poor magnet homogeneity include: shading, spatial distortion, blurring, intensity loss, curved slice profiles, and zebra (moir) banding artifacts. These image quality issues are most noticeable for large field-of-view studies and whenever gradient echo and fast/echo-planar sequences are used. Marked shading artifacts due to magnetic field inhomogeneities Fat suppression failure in neck MRI due to inhomogeneity One of the more commonly observed effects of poor homogeneity is seen on images using spectral fat suppression techniques. Fat and water resonances are separated by 3.5 ppm so any inhomogeneity (due to the underlying magnetic field irregularities or distortions created by the patient) close to or exceeding this value results in poor fat suppression. To perform MR spectroscopy (MRS), even higher levels of homogeneity are required, as the proton resonances you are trying to separate may differ by much less than 1 ppm. In addition to static homogeneity, for MRS it is also important to consider the temporal stability of the field. In other words, how long can the promised 1-ppm homogeneity be maintained? Is there drift in the field? If the spectral lines of interest are separated by only a few ppm, then temporal instability and magnet drift may ruin an experiment lasting more than a few minutes. If you are considering purchasing a permanent magnet system, it is important to ask about the temperature stability of the field. If the room temperature rises by a few degrees, by how much will the field change or lose homogeneity?", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-homogeneity.html"}

Are you telling me these are all wrong? These diagrams and explanations, which have long pervaded nearly all of the popular literature on MRI, are both incomplete and misleading, as they are based on a superficial interpretation of quantum mechanical principles. Diagrams from popular MRI and NMR sources that are all conceptually incorrect/misleading as to the nature of quantum \"reality\" as we understand it. I felt like the proverbial \"lone voice in the wilderness\" as I began to point out these interpretative problems in the early 1990's in my lectures as visiting professor and in the first edition of Questions and Answers in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (1994). But few people seemed to be receptive or even listening. Perhaps MR physics was hard enough by itself without further muddying the waters by tossing in philosophical issues of quantum reality! In 2001 I was delighted to see British chemist Malcom Levitt try to set things straight in his textbook, Spin Dynamics, now in its second edition and definitely worth acquiring. More recently Danish physicist Lars Hanson has helped bring these and other quantum misconceptions further into light through his educational web site ( http://www.drcmr.dk/MR ). Hopefully others will follow suit. Although it is perhaps easier to pretend these incorrect diagrams are \"harmless\", they nevertheless create their own set of problems for the serious thinker. If you are happy with these \"conventional\" explanations offered elsewhere, please skip to the next Q&A, because the following paragraphs will only serve to confuse you. But if the explanations offered in traditional sources haven't satisfied you, or if they have left you with more questions than answers, then read on. Over the years, some of our brighter students have sought to go beyond these simplistic explanations offered in textbooks, drawing complex arrays of spin-up and spin-down protons precessing in various phase configurations in an attempt to model more detailed features of the NMR phenomenon. I admit that it is immensely appealing to try to construct such models; I did this myself early on and even now occasionally resort to drawing spinning tops for our students (while biting my tongue, of course!). Although straightforward and comforting, these spinning top models depicting protons existing in only one of two orientations are fundamentally incorrect. No matter how complex one's arrays of spinning magnets become, the clever student will always be able to construct logical paradoxes exposing the models' inadequacies and inconsistencies. For example, if a proton can only point up or down, how do you make a 10 or 90 pulse? Why does the transverse magnetization immediately after a 90 pulse have exactly the same magnitude as the longitudinal magnetization immediately before the pulse? Why doesn't the RF field simply equalize the spin-up and spin-down populations? Why does continued application of the RF field cause the magnetization to rotate beyond 180 instead of simply forcing more and more protons into the spin-down state? And so on. To answer these and similar questions, spin-up and spin-down top models simply will not suffice. To this end it will first be necessary to learn a little more about the true quantum mechanical description of a nuclear spin. Although this discussion is not usually presented in most radiology textbooks, we hope that our explanations will point the way to the \"truth\", even if they do not reveal it completely or to everyone's satisfaction. At a minimum, the reader should gain some insight into the way things work in the subatomic world. With this hope in mind, here goes: Wave Function Formulation The quantum mechanical description of a subatomic particle like the proton is based upon the premise of its wave-particle duality (i.e., that the proton simultaneously possesses properties of both a particle and a wave). This wave-like character is expressed in terms of the wave function, (t) , which is a time-dependent solution to the Schrdinger equation describing the particle's energetics, with appropriate initial conditions and boundary constraints. In general,  (t) contains a number of harmonically oscillating terms, separable into those affecting each of the particle's principal states. A hydrogen nucleus has two principal states, also known as eigenstates , denoted by the so-called \"ket vectors\" |+ and |   , and its wave function can be written (t) = a |+ + b | where a and b are time-dependent quantum amplitudes incorporating \"harmonic oscillations\" of each principal state. For a single proton placed in an external magnetic field, quantum analysis reveals that the terms a and b each contain a single harmonic frequency ( f o and  f o , respectively), whose difference [ f o  ( f o )] is the Larmor frequency f o =  B o . Simple quantum mechanical descriptions of the NMR phenomena appearing in many books and websites imply that a spin can exist in either the spin-up or spin-down state exclusively and \"flip\" between them. These restrictions are not mandated in the wave function formulation and are actually misinterpretations of the wave function representation above. Quantum mechanics does not require that a spin reside exclusively in one or the other of its principal states; the only requirement is that the spin exist in some linear combination of the two states . Quantum \"Reality\" The early fathers of quantum mechanics (Bohr, Heisenberg, Dirac, Schrdinger, and even Einstein) also struggled with the meaning of these eigenstates and the underlying \"reality\" they represented. We have already encountered one such problem in interpreting the Stern-Gerlach experiment where we saw that two discrete spots of silver atoms were deposited on a plate after passing through a strong magnetic field. Whenever we try to observe a spin physically (e.g., by measuring its energy or angular momentum), we always obtain a result referable to one of the two principal states, never an intermediate value. Does this mean the particle exists only in one of the pure states? The dominant answer to this question for the last century has been \"No\", elucidated by Bohr and Heisenberg and incorporated into what has become known as the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics. Under this interpretation (as well as most others), the spin does not exist exclusively in one state or the other, but in a mixture of both states simultaneously. Whenever a physical measurement is made on the system, the wave function  (t) somehow \"collapses\" and only a single state is observed in the macroscopic world. Quantum \"reality\". The proton does not exist exclusively in a pure \"spin-up\" or \"spin-down\" state, but in a linear combination of the two. It does not flip between states but transitions gradually between the two. For a wave function with coefficients a and b , the probability of observing states |+  and |    can be shown to be | a | and | b | respectively. The wave function  (t) can therefore be thought of as a kind of probability distribution, expressing the likelihood that a given pure state will become revealed during a measuring experiment. Schrdinger's Cat, a thought experiment where the fate of a cat depends on a statistical quantum process involving radioactive decay. When the box is opened, the cat is either found dead or alive. But before the box is opened the Copenhagen interpretation would have us believe the cat is in some linear combination of |dead> and |alive> states. How can a cat be both alive and dead? Schrdinger's Cat The idea that a particle could simultaneously exist in two different quantum states was not immediately or widely accepted at first. Einstein never liked it, giving rise to his famous statement, \"God does not throw dice.\" Erwin Schrdinger went further to create his famous cat paradox (pictured left) to show what bizarre real-world conclusions might arise if one allowed multiple quantum states to exist simultaneously. Although the issue is far from settled, recent experiments by Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland leading to their 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics may have put this matter to rest. Their results demonstrate that spins can simultaneously reside in two states simultaneously. Working with different experimental setups, both Haroche and Wineland were able to trap photons and ions respectively in their superposition states, measuring and manipulating them in ways that were previously thought unattainable while preserving their quantum-mechanical nature. Haroche's and Wineland's work has allowed a better understanding of quantum superposition as well as the reasons why only a single state may be observed after a the measurement process. Although still the Copenhagen interpretation remains the most popular explanation of quantum reality, the Many Worlds Interpretation is gaining in popularity among physicists. In this model the proton also exists as a mixture of spin states prior to measurement, but instead of the wave function collapsing, the universe splits into two separate trajectories with each quantum decision. This fascinating approach to the universe is well beyond the scope of this web site, but the reader is encouraged to learn more about these ideas from the references below. Of course, the answers are not all in. Quantum mechanics remains incomplete and there remain many unanswered questions and problems, especially concerning entanglement and mechanism of action at a distance.

Processing of MRI data is usually performed in an array processor using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. These computational requirements generally require the input data to be in a matrix whose dimensions are a power of 2, such as 128x128, 256x256, or 512x512. If the acquired k -space data does not complete this matrix, it is customary to fill in the missing cells with zeroes, a technique called zero padding, zero filling , or zero-interpolation filling (ZIP) . ZIP in MRI has nothing to do with the *.zip technique of file compression. And nothing to do with postal codes either! Zero-filling is routinely used to expand the image matrix size in the phase-encoded direction. For 2D imaging this increase in matrix size is \"within-plane\" (e.g., from 256 to 512 pixels). For 3D imaging ZIP can be used \"through-plane\" to increase apparent resolution in the slab-select direction (e.g., from 64 to 128 slices). The gains occur for the first doubling of matrix size; thereafter, no benefit is realized. Although zero-filling does not add any information to the input raw data, it can nevertheless improve the apparent spatial resolution of the image due to reduced partial volume artifacts.

Linear measurements on MR phantom One of the most straightforward assessments of MR quality is to determine the accuracy of distance measurements. MR phantoms for this purpose contain a variety of tubes, grids, and other objects of known size that should be measured in each cardinal direction (slice, frequency, and phase) as well as obliquely. Measurements taken from the scan are compared to the known distances on the phantom, and a percent error can be calculated. In a phantom with a uniformly spaced grid, l inearity over the entire field-of-view can be determined using the coefficient of variation of the inter-grid distances measured. Various detailed procedures (see references below) for calculating linearity and geometric accuracy are available from the American College of Radiology (ACR) , National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) . Linearity errors should typically be less than 1%-2%. The most common cause of geometric errors is miscalibration of one or more imaging gradients.

In MRI we often focus on magnetic fields like B o and B 1 , so it is easy to forget that a coexisting electric field ( E ) is always present. As described by the Maxwell equations , B and E fields oscillate perpendicular to each other and to the direction of wave propagation. When electromagnetic waves encounter the human body, several phenomena occur: 1) the wavelength decreases; 2) electrical currents are generated; and 3) wave reflection/refraction may develop at tissue interfaces. The term dielectric effect refers to the interaction of matter with the E component of an electromagnetic field. Abnormal bright and dark areas due to B1 field inhomogeneity are frequently noted at very high fields (3T and above). Although the nature of these artifacts is not entirely clear, these are commonly referred to as dielectric artifacts . \"Dielectric\" artifact at 7.0T. Center of brain is abnormally brightened. \"Dielectric\" artifact at 3.0T. Center of abdomen with ascites is abnormally darkened. RF wavelengths in tissue as a function of field strength. The argument that these artifacts are due to dielectric effects is based on considering RF-wavelengths in tissues as a function of field strength. As can be seen in the diagram left, at fields of 1.5T and lower, RF wavelengths are long compared to the size of the body. As the magnetic field is increased, these wavelengths become the same or smaller than the anatomic regions imaged. In theory standing wave currents might arise flowing in opposite directions from two sides of the patient creating a pattern with destructive interference (dark areas) and constructive interference (bright areas) separated by quarter wavelengths. The degree to which significant dielectric resonances cause these bright and dark areas remain controversial. The relatively high electrical conductivity of tissues introduces a \"skin-depth\" term that serves to damp standing wave phenomena. Central brightening has been demonstrated in high-conductivity phantoms where dielectric resonances should be minimal. In summary, dielectric effects and associated artifacts are progressively important as field strength increases, although a simplistic model of dielectric-induced standing waves may only explain a small part of the phenomenon.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dielectric-effect.html"}

More complex solid pads contain suspensions of metal (primarily barium and calcium) titanates in deuterated or protonated water.

The first decision is to choose between Single Voxel Spectroscopy (SVS) and Multi-Voxel Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) . If MVSI is chosen then either a 2D method (imaging an array of voxels in a single plane) or 3D method (imaging an entire volume of voxels) must then be selected. In general, SVS methods are easier and quicker to perform with higher signal-to-noise than MVSI, but suffer from poorer spatial resolution. Select MRS technique and parameters . Although several MRS sequences are available, some variant of PRESS (Point REsolved SpectoScopy) . is most commonly used. Other options include STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode) or simple spin-echo acquisition. Imaging parameters such as TR , TE , FOV, NEX, and voxel size(s) must also be specified. Typically a medium length TR is chosen (1500-2000 msec). Separately acquired short TE (~30 msec) and medium TE (~144 msec) studies are both usually performed to reveal various metabolites to best advantage. Place MRS volume over anatomy of interest . Care must be taken that the imaging region does not include fat-containing scalp or bone marrow that may contaminate the spectrum. Outer volume saturation bands are generally required to be placed over these areas to suppress signal from fat. Shimming and Calibration . Shimming is fine-tuning of the magnetic field homogeneity by adjusting currents passing though specialized shim coils next to the gradients. Automated shimming is usually sufficient for routine head MRS studies, but manual adjustments may be necessary. Perform MRS Imaging . Typical image acquisition times are 5-15 minutes, depending on technique and size of volume studied. View/analyze spectra . Separate spectra are generated for each MRS voxel which can then be analyzed visually or overlaid as color maps on anatomic images. Optional post-processing may be performed to identify and quantify detected peaks.

Frequency-encoding of spatial position is accomplished through the use of supplemental magnetic field gradients. Gradients mildly distort the main magnetic field in a predictable pattern, causing the resonance frequency to vary as a function of position. Frequency-encoding may be used to define location either: 1) within a slice, or 2) between slices. Frequency Encoding for In-Plane Localization The figure right shows how frequency-encoding may be used to specify position within a slice. Here a frequency-encoding gradient ( G f ) begins on the left of the image at position x =0 and increases linearly along the horizontal axis. If the main (static) magnetic field is B o , then the effective field B ( x ) at any point ( x ) along the horizontal axis is given by B ( x ) = B o + x G f From the Larmor equation ( f = B) , we can easily show that the resonant frequency f ( x ) also varies linearly with position ( x ) along the frequency-encoding axis: f ( x ) = B ( x ) = B o +  xG f = f o + f g ( x ) where f o is the main field Larmor frequency and f g ( x ) is the frequency offset based on position along the gradient. A linearly increasing frequency-encoding gradient ( G f ) applied along the horizontal ( x- ) axis. Pixels A, B, and C all resonate at the same lower frequency; D, E and F at the same higher frequency. Each pixel has a finite width, so actually contains a small range of frequencies (called the per pixel bandwidth ) rather than just a single frequency. Nevertheless, the signals in any column (such as ABC) have all been assigned to the same narrow band of frequencies, and these are different from the signal frequencies of another column (such as DEF). Although frequency-encoding is a big step, we are still not able to discriminate between pixels within a column (e.g. A vs B vs C) because their frequencies overlap. Spatial detection in this second dimension will require another method, typically phase-encoding . Frequency Encoding for Slice Selection Frequency-encoding can also be used to define the position of entire slices in 2D imaging. The basic principle is the same as for within-plane frequency-encoding, but now the gradient is applied along the slice-select direction. The center resonant frequency of entire slices will now vary linearly as a function of position. A single slice may be stimulated by applying an RF-pulse tuned to specifically to the frequencies in that slice. The design of such RF-pulses and more details of slice selection are found in later Q&A's. Magnetic field gradient applied in the z-direction causes the resonant frequencies to vary by a few thousand Hz from slice to slice.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/frequency-encoding.html"}

Several international safety organizations and government agencies have published relevant standards and methods for estimating and measuring implant-related heating in the MR environment. The three most important are the American Society of Testing and Materials International (ASTM) , the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) , and the International Standards Organization (ISO) . American Society of Testing and Materials International (F2182) ASTM standard F2182 is restricted to RF -heating of wholly-implanted passive devices in cylindrical magnets at 1.5T and 3.0T . A procedure is described using a saline-based gel-filled phantom of approximately the same dimensions of the body part where the implant is located. The gel is doped to have electrical and thermal properties similar to human tissue. Temperature change in and around the implant is recorded following 15 minutes of continuous RF exposure to an SAR of at least 2 W/kg averaged over the volume of the phantom. A) Gel-filled torso phantom for evaluating heating of a pacemaker and wire (arrows). A black temperature probe is attached to the tip of the pacemaker lead. B) Heat map assessed by infrared camera after RF excitation showing temperature increase at the lead tip. (From Winter et al under CC-BY.) International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60601-2-33) IEC 60601-2-33 is a 100+ page document dealing with multiple aspects of MRI safety and performance, of which implant heating is only a small part. One of the important advances of this standard with regard to implants is the recommended use of B1 +rms over SAR. The term B 1+rms refers to the \"root mean square\" value of B 1+ , the RF-field rotating in the same direction as magnetic precession and responsible for tipping the nuclear magnetization. The advantage of using B 1+rms over SAR is that B1 +rms can be directly calculated by measuring transmitter voltages producing the incident RF irradiation. More details about B1 +rms can be found in this associated Q&A . Another component of the IEC standard is the provision for a Fixed Parameter Option (FBO) by which manufacturers may certify their devices as MR conditional under a restricted set of RF and gradient field outputs. International Standards Organization (ISO/TS 10974) This is the most comprehensive approach to implant heating issues, although the current standard covers only active devices in cylindrical 1.5T scanners (an updated standard is expected by 2021-2). A four-tiered approach is taken, each level progressively resulting in less restrictive conditions for imaging for the implant but requiring a more complex analysis. In brief, the 4 tiers are RF heating measurements made in phantoms for worst case scenarios. No modeling required. Basic human body electromagnetic modeling to predict locations of the highest electric fields to which the implant might be exposed. Modeling of both the human body and the implant, with calculation of electrical fields tangential to the device. Concurrent human and implant modeling. In general, Tier 1 and 2 assessments are usually done for small compact devices, such as cochlear implants, pressure sensors, implanted monitors and leadless pacemakers. Tier 3 is required for larger and more complex devices, while Tier 4 is only infrequently performed due to its complexity. All mathematical simulations must be verified by actual measurements in a tissue-mimicking phantom similar to that pictured above and described in ASTM F2182. In addition to RF-heating, ISO/TS 10974 describes similar tiered procedures for evaluating gradient-induced implant heating. Methods for measuring gradient-induced vibration of implants are also included.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/estimate-implant-heating.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Mentor CX2 breast tissue expander Tissue expanders are balloon-like devices temporarily placed in the operative bed after mastectomy during the first stage of breast reconstruction. They typically have silicone outer shells and a superficial valve or port. Saline is injected at regular intervals over several months to stretch the skin and overlying muscles. Once they have attained their desired size, the expanders are removed and replaced with permanent saline or silicone-gel breast prostheses (all of which are MR Safe ). Breast tissue expanders in most common use today are manufactured by Mentor (Johnson & Johnson), Allergan, and Sientra. MAGNA-SITE port (From Yoon under CC BY) MAGNA-SITE injection port in a breast tissue expander (arrow points to the magnet) For the last 25 years, most tissue expanders have included a MAGNA-SITE port for injection. This port consists of a central Neodymium magnet set into the base of a titanium plate with a slight rim. The plate serves as puncture-proof needle guard. The injection site can be easily located using a hand-held magnetic finder. Because the expander is usually placed deep to the pectoralis muscle, the port cannot be identified by palpation. Notwithstanding its clinical utility, the presence of a magnetic injection port is problematic concerning MR safety. Several cases have been reported where patients have experienced localized heating or discomfort or have actually had their ports dislodged during MRI. Although the number of such incidents is very small, every major manufacturer of tissue expanders with magnetic ports have declared these devices to be MR Unsafe . Notwithstanding these restrictions, radiologists at Cornell have performed 1.5T MRI on over 200 patients with magnetic ports without any complications or problems. A second MR Unsafe type of tissue expander is the unique AeroForm System ( AirXpanders ). Instead of using injectable saline, the AeroForm contains a stainless-steel canister filled with pressurized CO 2 gas that expands the implant. An antenna and electronic circuitry is also present to receive the signal transmitted from a hand-held controller that triggers incremental gas release. \"MR Unsafe\" AeroForm Expanders Fortunately, a few tissue expanders exist that do not contain magnets and can be used in the MR environment: options exist for tissue expanders that are MR Conditional.

What is he talking about? Homogeneity refers to the uniformity of a magnetic field in the center of a scanner when no patient is present. Magnetic field homogeneity is measured in parts per million ( ppm ) over a certain diameter of spherical volume ( DSV ). For example, a 3.0T magnet may guaranteed to have a homogeneity of <1 ppm over a 40 cm DSV. This means that no two points within  20 cm of the magnet isocenter differ in magnetic field strength by more than one part in a million, or by no more than 3.0T x (1/1,000,000) or 0.000003T. When comparing homogeneity specifications from different vendors, it is important to be sure the quoted DSVs are the same. Magnetic homogeneities will always look better if smaller DSVs are quoted, and inhomogeneity increases dramatically as the DSV is increased. For example, a scanner that has a homogeneity of 1 ppm over a 40 cm DSV may only have homogeneity of 3 ppm over a 45 cm DSV. You should also be aware that when your new MR magnet arrives fresh from the factory, its homogeneity will likely be 100 ppm or more -- a far cry from the 1-3 ppm promised to you by your sales representative. But do not despair. Once the magnet is installed and ramped up to full field, it will undergo a set of checks and calibrations that will bring it to within homogeneity specifications.

Excluding several transient sensory disturbances described below, as well as the secondary risk of projectile injuries, the static magnetic fields used in MRI probably create no significant adverse health effects on patients or staff. This conclusion is supported by multiple recent review papers, several of which are provided in the References . It should be noted, however, that evidence does exist for some low-level biological effects at the microscopic level in certain cell suspension and animal experiments, but these typically employ fields that are stronger or at longer exposures than humans receive in the MR environment. Like many questions in science, the final answers are not in, but the fact that over 400 million MRI exams have been safely performed worldwide to date provides some reassurance that static fields in MRI pose minimal risks. To have a biological effect, static magnetic fields must operate through one of several known physical mechanisms: 1. Lorentz Force . The Lorentz force is experienced by charged particles moving through a magnetic field, discussed in a prior Q&A . In theory the Lorentz force could have subtle effects on cellular transmembrane potentials and transport through ionic channels, but as yet no conclusive evidence this occurs at the field strengths used in clinical MRI. However, it is likely that the Lorentz force does act effect ionic currents in the middle ear endolymph and be responsible for the transient sensations of vertigo/dizziness/nausea commonly noted at 7.0T and above. A full Q&A is devoted to this topic. Lorentz force (F) on an electric current (I) passing through a magnetic field (B). When blood flows through a magnetic field the Lorentz force differentially deflects positive and negative ions toward opposite sides of the vessel. This creates a potential difference known as the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) effect . As described in another Q&A , the MHD effect produces artifactual changes in recorded EKG voltages but no harmful effects on the body. 2. Motion-Induced Currents . The Faraday-Lenz Law states that an electric field (or current) is induced in a conductor whenever it moves through a static magnetic field. This mechanism its thought responsible for generation of visual light flashes ( magnetophosphenes ) during eye motion (discussed in this related Q&A ) and metallic taste by tongue motion (discussed in this related Q&A ). Faraday-Lenz Law Translational ( F trans ) and rotational ( F rot ) forces on a magnetizable object placed in an external magnetic field ( B o ) 3. Susceptibility-induced forces . S usceptibility (  ) is an intrinsic property of matter describing how it becomes polarized when when placed in an external magnetic field. The polarization of diamagnetic materials (such as water, simple salts and calcium) opposes the applied field, resulting an a repulsive force. The polarization of paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials (such as ferrites and hemosiderin) augments the applied field, resulting in an attractive force. For either repulsion or attraction, the result may be translation or rotational movement of the molecule, cell, or anatomic structure. Most of the human body is composed of diamagnetic materials with susceptibilities close to zero, and the repulsive force from an external field is weak compared to gravity and thermal motions. Paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials, however, have much larger susceptibilities, and forces on them may be moderate. This is especially the case for materials whose susceptibilities are highly directionally dependent (anisotropic). \"Stacking\" of sickle cells perpendicular to an external magnetic field due to susceptibility-related anisotropy Sickle cell erythrocytes, which stack themselves perpendicular to an external magnetic field, are perhaps the most easily visualized demonstration of anisotropic susceptibility. Other examples include retinal rods and proteins/polypeptides (especially those containing an  -helix or harboring a peripheral paramagnetic ion). Anisotropic susceptibility can produce forces 100x stronger than isotropic susceptibility, so this potential mechanism cannot be cursorily dismissed. However, it remains speculative whether anisotropic torques on DNA, proteins, and the like due to strong magnetic fields produce clinically significant effects. In the 1980's several authorities expressed concern about performing MRI scans in patients with sickle cell disease, worried that magnetically-induced cell stacking might potentiate thrombosis. These concerns proved unfounded, however, and now many thousands of sickle cell patients have been safely scanned without incident. Regulatory Limits for Patients and Staff The two most important international organizations promulgating regulatory guidelines for patient and occupational exposure to static magnetic fields are the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) . Unfortunately, their recommendations differ. For example, the IEC defines 3T as the upper limit for scanning patients in normal operating mode, while the ICNIRP has a more lenient limit of 4T. An even greater discordance occurs for staff, with 8T set as the maximum exposure for head and trunk by the IEC, but only 2T allowed in non-controlled mode by the ICNIRP. The typical MRI worker is not commonly in the magnet room during scanning; therefore she is only occasionally exposed to gradient or radiofrequency fields. The main occupational exposure is from being around the static ( Bo ) fringe field intermittently for most of the day. With self-shielded scanners, the peak static field exposure for staff is unlikely to exceed 50% of B o , and the average exposure over a shift would be only a few mT. For MR staff working around scanners with field strengths of 3T or higher, however, short term sensory effects (including nausea and dizziness) have been clearly demonstrated. For example, the incidence of vertigo among staff working at 1.5T, 3.0T, and 7.0T has been reported to be about 4%, 8%, and 24% respectively. These effects can be mitigated by moving slowly around the scanner or at the scanner bore to minimize dB/dt in the fringe field.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/static-field-bioeffects.html"}

The concept underlying synthetic MRI dates back to the early 1980's  if intrinsic tissue parameters (T1, T2, etc) were known on a voxel-by-voxel basis, it would be possible to mathematically simulate MR images generated by any pulse sequence. The idea lay relatively dormant until the mid 2000's when new rapid parameter estimation sequences were developed and integrated into user-friendly commercial products. Software from the Swedish company SyMRI has been licensed for synthetic imaging to Siemens, GE, and Philips. GE calls their version MAGiC (MAGnetic resonance image Compilation) while Philips calls theirs SyntAc (Synthetic Acquisition) . Synthesized brain images acquired in a single acquisition (Courtesy GE) The SyMRI acquisition sequence developed by Warntjes et al. for measuring intrinsic tissue parameters is known as QRAPMASTER (Quantification of Relaxation times And Proton density by Multi-echo Acquisition of a Saturation-recovery using Turbo spin Echo Readout) . As suggested by its lengthy name, this is a multi-slice TSE sequence with several echoes generated at different saturation delays. With 6 echoes and 4 delay times, for example, the sequence would produce 6 x 4 = 24 images per slice, from which a least-squares fitting process could calculate T1, T2, and spin density for each pixel. From these parameters mathematically synthesized images of other pulse sequences with arbitrarily chosen TR's , TE's , and TI's can be created. It is also possible to generate quantitative parameter maps of T1, T2, and even perform some basic image segmentation. Initial clinical studies have demonstrated that synthetic imaging may be acceptable for routine brain MR, although a learning curve is needed as the image contrasts on certain sequences may appear somewhat different than expected. Additional limitations include: 1) lack of simultaneous multi-planar imaging  all synthetic images must be in the same plane; 2) no T2* or susceptibility-based contrast; and 3) sequence-specific artifacts such as incomplete CSF suppression and pseudo-edge enhancement on T2-FLAIR images.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/synthetic-mri.html"}

Simultaneous Multi-Slice (SMS) imaging , also known as MultiBand (MB) imaging , employs complex RF-pulses together with parallel imaging coil arrays to acquire several sections along the z -axis simultaneously. This allows a significant reduction in image acquisition time with little signal-to-noise penalty. As described in a prior Q&A , the historical precursor to modern MB/SMS methods was POMP (Phase Offset MultiPlanar) imaging. The POMP technique used a composite RF-pulse to simultaneously excite two slices, each of which were phase-encoded over only one-half of the total field-of-view (FOV). Phase alternation allowed the two slices to be separately reconstructed without overlap. Unlike SMS, POMP does not utilize parallel imaging technology and is hence applicable to single-channel RF coils. MultiBand, like POMP, begins with a composite pulse that excites several slices simultaneously. MB pulses can be designed in several ways, but the most straightforward method is to sum several standard RF waveforms with different phase offsets together. The number of simultaneous slices is referred to as the MB or SMS acceleration factor . In current commercial implementations (Siemens' SMS , GE's HyperBand , and Philips' Multi-band SENSE ), acceleration factors of 2-4 are typical. To take advantage of parallel imaging acceleration, MB uses coil encoding together with either gradient- or RF-encoding to resolve data along the slice-select ( z )-axis. Because modern coil arrays typically have only a few coil elements in the z -direction, coil sensitivity differences along that axis are rather poor. Accordingly the simultaneously excited slices must be spaced widely apart (typically at least 2530 mm) as shown in the diagram. An interleaving technique is then used to excite missing slices in the gaps. To overcome the limitations of coil-encoding, the CAIPIRINHA technique was developed. CAIPIRINHA stands for \"Controlled Aliasing In Parallel Imaging Results In Higher Acceleration\" and is the subject of a later Q&A . The underlying idea is that to avoid overlap in reconstruction, simultaneously excited slices can be shifted within the phase encoding direction in a \"controlled\" fashion. Hence slices very close together can be separated, even when a coil has little encoding power in the z -direction. Currently the most widely used method for BOLD and diffusion-weighted SMS imaging is called blipped-CAIPI , so named because of the use of blipped rewinder gradients to keep phase accumulation within the range of 180 while imparting a constant phase shift between adjacent lines of k -space. Reconstruction of the SMS data can be performed using either SENSE, GRAPPA, or hybrid techniques. Because of the large amount of data rapidly acquired, computation demand is high and image reconstruction times can be long. The blipped-CAIPI method for echo-planar imaging. A MB pulse simultaneously excites three (3) slices defined together with the slice-select gradient. In-plane k -space is traversed by oscillation of the frequency (readout) gradient with stepping along the phase-encode direction. \"Blipped\" gradients pulses (red) are applied along the slice-select direction during the readout gradient switching and simultaneously with the phase encoding pulses. This creates the constant required phase modulation between the simultaneously excited slices. Every third blipped pulse is of larger magnitude and opposite polarity serving to rewind the net phase and normalize the gradient moment. The end result is \"controlled\" aliasing over FOV/3. Unlike standard parallel imaging acceleration techniques, MB/SMS acceleration results in little to no penalty in signal-to-noise. This is because neither the echo train length, number of phase-encoding steps, nor number of k -space samples has been reduced as occurs in conventional parallel imaging acceleration methods. Eddy currents due to rapid gradient switching may still create Nyquist-like ghosts that affect SMS images. Another artifact resulting in decreased imaging quality in SMS imaging is known as residual aliasing or slice leakage . This reconstruction artifact can be very insidious, manifest only as hazy noise on certain images. It is especially problematic for fMRI studies that depend on the same expected signal from adjacent slices in an acquisition.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/simultaneous-multi-slice.html"}

In the 1950s and 1960s considerably progress was made in explaining the the physical principles underlying T1 and T2 relaxation in pure liquids and simple solutions. It was soon recognized that these theories gave incorrect predictions when applied to biological specimens, however. Several factors accounted for these discrepancies: Tissues contain macromolecules (proteins, phospholipids, polysaccharides, fat) in addition to water. Tissues are compartmentalized. A small but significant portion of the water in tissue is not free, but tightly or moderately bound to macromolecules. Hydration layers around a macromolecule The cytosol of mammalian cells is extremely crowded, and there is restricted movement of larger proteins that are forced into globular shapes. H protons deep within these macromolecules have restricted motions, resulting in very short T2 values (often 1 ms or less). The signals from these protons decay so quickly that they may be undetectable by \"conventional\" MR imaging methods using TE values longer than 1 ms. Tightly bound H 2 O molecules immediately adjacent to the macromolecules or within their crevices behave in a similar fashion, possessing very short T2 values with signals decaying so rapidly that they may also be undetectable by conventional imaging techniques and part of the so-called MR \"dark matter\" . Although not directly visualized, these bound water molecules they can undergo dipolar interactions and chemical exchange both with macromolecular protons and those in the free water pool. There is also an intermediate layer of water molecules with characteristics between the free and bound forms. The presence of macromolecules slows the normally rapid rotation and diffusion of the smaller water molecules by means of hydrogen bonding and other interactions. Reduced motion means that a higher proportion of HOH nuclei will experience both static fields (reducing T2) and interactions near the Larmor frequency (reducing T1). The degree of T1 and T2 shortening depends on: 1) the concentration of the macromolecules, 2) their size, and 3) the number of hydrophilic groups (amine, hydroxyl, and carboxyl) to bind water molecules. The interaction between free and bound pools is discussed more completely in several later Q&A's where the concept of magnetization transfer is explained.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/macromolecule-effects.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding In the United States approximately 100,000 patients per year present to emergency rooms with gunshot wounds. When these patients require an MRI (either acutely or years later), the presence of retained bullet fragments and shrapnel pose important safety concerns that must be addressed. Firearm projectiles are commonly divided into three groups: BB's and pellets are small projectiles fired using an air- or spring-loaded gun. BB's are spherical and made of ferromagnetic steel coated with copper or zinc (to resist corrosion). Pellets typically have a mushroom shape (for aerodynamics) and are predominantly made of lead or tin-based alloys, but occasionally copper or steel. Above: Lead pellet and copper-coated steel BB Right: Steel buckshot in a cartridge Shot are multiple spherical pellets packed into a single casing ejected by a gunpowder charge. Traditionally shot is made from lead, but due to poisoning concerns in hunted wildlife, many states have banned lead shot in favor of steel. Bullets are solid or multilayered projectiles ejected by a gunpowder charge within a metal casing (shell). Solid bullets are typically made of lead or copper/zinc. Jacketed bullets have an external metal covering that can be steel, copper, or brass. Some bullets have a copper shell but a steel core. Others are copper and lead with a steel tip. Steel-containing jacketed MR bullets (shell casing containing gunpowder has been removed) Regardless of their metallic composition, bullets, shot, and bits of shrapnel do not produce significant RF-heating due to their overall small dimensions. Projectiles composed of only non-ferromagnetic materials (e.g., lead, copper, brass, or zinc) neither undergo heating nor significant translational or or rotational forces. They should thus be considered OK to scan under any conditions. The primary safety concern is for projectiles containing ferromagnetic steel which can move significantly when placed in a strong external magnetic field. My basic approach to screening patients with gunshot injuries involves assessing the diagnostic benefit of MRI vs the risk. The benefit analysis depends on the particular clinical scenario and the likelihood that an alternative technique (such as CT or US) could answer the diagnostic question. My risk analysis, described below, is based upon the a priori probability that the projectile is ferromagnetic, as well as its precise anatomic location and time since injury. Assessing the Probability of Ferromagnetism All bullets and shrapnel acquired in military service or overseas should be considered ferromagnetic unless proven otherwise. All BB's and pellets should be considered ferromagnetic. All shotgun pellets should be considered ferromagnetic, although about half are not. Pellets that distort into multiple irregular (non-rounded) shapes are more likely to be made of lead. Bullets from pistols and handguns in the USA virtually never contain steel, as their manufacture and sale (but not possession) has been a federal crime since the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1986. Bullets from domestic handguns implanted more than 25 years ago should be considered ferromagnetic out of extra caution, although the probability is low. Armor-piercing steel-jacketed and steel-cored bullets can and are legally sold for use in rifles in the USA and elsewhere. Being so powerful/penetrating they would likely pass straight through a person unless stopped by a large bone. Although the probability is small that a domestic rifle bullet found on screening would be ferromagnetic, it should assumed to be so out of caution. Steel jacketed ammunition represents a large amount of \"non-defense\" ammunition (i.e., that meant for target practice) \"Defense\" ammunition, synonymous with hollow point or expanding ammunition, never contains a steel jacket as it does not aid in projectile expansion and fragmentation Some superficially located ferromagnetic pellets and bullets may be positively identified by a hand-held ferromagnetic metal detector; but a negative reading should be considered inconclusive. Some investigators have proposed using expanded range dynamic CT or dual-energy CT to determine bullet composition, but to date the results have been variable. A final interesting approach has been recently proposed by Fountain et al (2021). The method involves looking at the projectile on x-ray and noting either if it is deformed (in the absence of hitting bone) or has left a debris trail. Either of these features implies a lead or other non-steel composition that is relatively \"soft\", having been designed to disperse its energy upon impact. If you don't see deformity or a debris trail you still may have a lead projectile, but you should probably treat it as though it might be ferromagnetic. I have not personally used this method, but it makes sense. Deformed bullet in the neck with a debris trail (arrows) suggesting this is not a steel-containing projectile. Assessing Risk of Injury Based on Projectile Location and Age If a projectile does contain steel and is subjected to magnetic displacement forces, the risk to the patient depends on its precise anatomic location and how long ago implantation occurred. In vitro experiments with ferromagnetic bullets placed in gelatin or animal organs have been shown to move by up to 10 cm at 1.5T and 3.0T. So a recently acquired ferromagnetic bullet embedded in relatively \"soft\" soft tissues (e.g., brain, liver, spleen, lung) or in fat near major vessels, nerves, or solid organs carries a high risk of movement and possible injury. Conversely, ferromagnetic projectiles embedded in \"tougher\" solid tissues like bone, tendons, or skeletal muscle are much less likely to move enough to cause significant damage. The length of time since implantation should also be considered. Projectiles embedded months or years before are more likely to be restrained by a capsule of scar tissue, limiting their motion and potential damage. Non-Firearm Shrapnel The same rules above generally apply to non-firearm derived shrapnel, such as fragments from bombs, industrial accidents, and metal-working. Out of an abundance of safety, all such shrapnel should be considered ferromagnetic until proven otherwise. Shrapnel pieces may be larger and longer than bullets, and may therefore experience more magnetic displacement/torque and be at risk for RF-heating. The edge characteristics of the shrapnel should also be considered, with sharp edges near critical anatomic structures an additional risk.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/bullets-and-shrapnel.html"}

Can't you just invert the bright blood image on a monitor and get the same effect? Vertebral artery dissection (arrow). Note dark blood \"flow voids\" in other arteries (but not the veins). Dark Blood MR Angiography is vascular imaging strategy wherein the signal from flowing blood is suppressed (rendering it \"black\") rather than enhanced as it is in conventional Bright Blood MRA techniques. Rapidly flowing or turbulent blood has a naturally low signal because of phase-dispersion and time-of-flight signal losses. These effects may be further accentuated by application of flow-spoiling gradients, saturation bands, and/or inversion pulses. The well-recognized vascular \"flow voids\" seen on routine MR imaging represent a crude form of dark-blood MRA. In theory, dark-blood MRA has some unique advantages compared to bright-blood techniques. Flow separation and turbulence, which cause unwanted signal losses and overestimation of stenoses on bright-blood MRA, paradoxically improve image quality on dark-blood MRA. Because intraluminal signal is suppressed, vessels containing \"black blood\" do not generate pulsation (ghosting) artifacts. Additionally, the lack of intraluminal signal allows the walls of vessels (or cardiac chambers) to be clearly delineated. For these reasons, dark-blood techniques are predominantly used in cardiac imaging and for evaluation of diseases of the vessel wall (atherosclerotic plaque and dissection). Notwithstanding these specific cardiovascular applications, dark-blood MRA has never taken hold as a widely used method for the head, abdomen, or extremities. Although an excellent method for imaging high-flow vessels, dark-blood techniques are less sensitive to slower flow states. \"Black\" blood is difficult to separate from adjacent low-signal non-vascular structures, such as calcifications, cortical bone, and air. To convert a set of dark-blood source images into an angiographic-style picture requires a minimum intensity projection method. By comparison, bright-blood MRA is typically displayed using a maximum intensity projection algorithm. The minimum intensity method required for dark-blood MRA requires considerable manual editing to exclude air (both inside and around the patient) as well as cortical bone and other low signal non-vascular structures. As such, dark-blood MRA studies are usually displayed as tomographic sections rather than as angiogram-like projections. A dark-blood MR angiogram is not the same as simply inverting the gray-scale image of a bright-blood MR angiogram. Completely different methods are responsible for the vascular contrast observed. Thin-slice 2D or 3D Fast Spin Echo (FSE) sequences can be used to generate dark-blood MRA's that can be reconstructed using multiplanar or curvilinear displays. This method is especially useful in the brain where a T2-weighted FSE sequence produces high signal from CSF in contrast to the black vessels. Flow-spoiled black blood MRA is part of Canon's V-TRACE sequence. The degree of vascular dephasing may be increased by applying weak, diffusion-like spoiling gradients along all three axes in a 3D GRE sequence. The result is an increased sensitivity toward more slowly flowing blood in smaller vessels. This method is part of Canon's V-TRACE (\"Variable True Rate Angiography with Combined Encodings\") technique. V-TRACE acquires acquires a bright-blood MRA image simultaneously without flow spoiling at a shorter TE . The black blood image is usually not displayed separately but subtracted from the bright-blood image to improve visualization of smaller vessels. The above-described methods of black-blood imaging rely primarily upon MR flow phenomena to create dark intraluminal signal (potentially supplemented by flow-spoiling gradients or saturation bands). Two additional important methods of dark-blood imaging, Inversion Recovery (IR) Black Blood MRA and Susceptibility-Weighted (SW) Black Blood MRA , exploit the relaxation times of blood to create a black blood effect. These important methods are described in detail in subsequent Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dark-vs-bright-blood.html"}

In addition to the visual inspection of cardiac wall motion and thickening on cine studies, quantitative analysis of global ventricular function is also routinely performed at most centers. After downloading data to an independent workstation, technologists trace the inner margins of the myocardium throughout the cardiac cycle. Semiautomated software now exists to assist with this process, but must always be checked by a human for accuracy. The outer myocardial borders may also be traced. The patient's weight and height are entered, allowing normalization of calculated functional parameters to a standard body surface area (BSA) of 1.8 m. Automated ventricular function contours on short axis cine (Courtesy Siemens) A typical left ventricular (LV) function study begins with single-slice, TrueFISP/balanced SSFP cine images in 2-chamber, 3-chamber, and 4-chamber views. For most cooperative patients without significant arrhythmias these can each be obtained using retrospective gating in a single breath-hold. The core LV function sequence comes next  a short-axis cine of 8-12 slices perpendicular to the long axis of the LV spanning from the mitral valve to the apex throughout the cardiac cycle. These are obtained in multiple breath-holds with retrospective gating. The field-of-view (FOV) should be rotated to avoid wrap-around artifact. Total left ventricular (LV) volumes are calculated by multiplying the cross-sectional areas in each short-axis slice by the slice thickness plus inter-slice gap ( Simpson's rule ). Global ventricular functional parameters generated by this process include End diastolic volume (EDV) = largest size of ventricular cavity during diastole (relaxation) End systolic volume (ESV) = smallest size of ventricular cavity during contraction (systole) Stroke volume (SV) = EDVESV = volume of blood displaced in 1 heart beat Ejection fraction (EF) = SV/EDV = % of blood displaced in 1 heart beat Cardiac output (CO) = SV x heart rate = total volume of blood displaced in 1 minute Cardiac index (CI) = CO/BSA = cardiac output normalized to body surface area Semi-automated ventricular function analysis is available from most MR vendors and independent companies, as in this example from the Siemens Argus system. Only LV volumes are usually calculated routinely, but the method can be applied to the right ventricle (RV) as well. Clinical scenarios requiring RV measurements include evaluation of patients with congenital heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). RV function may be difficult to assess by echocardiography due to is location directly beneath the sternum. A typical RV function study begins with single-slice, retrospectively-gated vertical long-axis and RV outflow tract cine's. The core measurement sequence is a stack of 8-12 transverse images covering the entire RV and outflow tract. Cardiac MR is now generally considered the \"gold standard\" for clinical measurement of both LV and RV function, superior to echocardiography, nuclear, and catheter ventriculography. Multiple studies in humans and animals have documented that functional parameters obtained by MRI have high reproducibility, accuracy, and low intraobserver and interobserver variability.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ventricular-function.html"}

Perfusion refers to the rate of blood flow through the capillary circulation of an organ or tissue. To account for different sized organs, perfusion is commonly normalized as bulk blood flow rate (mL/min) divided by organ mass (per 100 g). Perfusion is thus typically reported in units of mL/min/100g tissue . Perfusion differs among organs and may change in response to pathology or metabolic needs. For example, the perfusion of cerebral gray and white matter are about 60 and 20 mL/min/100g respectively. Myocardial perfusion is much greater, ranging between about 100 mL/min/100g at rest to 400 mL/min/100g during maximal exercise. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion map of brain with hypervascular glioma Measurement of perfusion requires the use of tracers -- molecules, molecular aggregates, or small particles that distribute in tissues commensurate with blood flow and can be detected. Some remain in the intravascular space, but others have a wider distribution. Intravascular tracers remain confined to blood vessels. MR examples include the (now out-of-production) contrast agent gadofosveset (Ablavar) which bound to serum albumin and ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particles. Extracellular tracers do not enter cells but freely pass through vessel walls to distribute in the extracellular spaces of tissues. Most gadolinium-based contrast agents are in this category. Diffusible tracers distribute throughout all tissue compartments including the interior of cells. A common example in MRI is magnetically tagged water molecules used for arterial spin labelling (ASL) .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/measuring-perfusion.html"}

Understanding the MR appearance of hemorrhage is indeed complicated, but manageable if broken down into its individual components. Only a brief overview will be provided here. Subsequent Q&As will offer expansion and reinforcement of each subtopic in detail. Composition of Blood and Hematomas Circulating blood is composed of liquid and cellular elements. Plasma , the liquid portion, is mostly water, and thus has relatively long T1 and T2 values. The cellular elements are mainly erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs) containing hemoglobin (Hb), the iron-based macromolecules responsible for oxygen transport. The magnetic properties of Hb derivatives provide the dominant mechanism of MR image contrast at magnetic fields of 0.5T and greater. Hemorrhage is the escape of blood from vessels into surrounding tissues. A discrete collection of clotted blood is known as a hematoma . The microstructure of a hematoma also affects its MR imaging characteristics, a phenomenon important at field strengths below 0.5T. Photomicrograph of an acute hematoma showing clumped RBCs separated by fibrin strands Histologically, an acute hematoma consists of RBCs trapped in a matrix of fibrin interspersed with small pools of serum. This microscopic heterogeneity and clumping of RBCs results in spin dephasing, loss of signal on T2/T2*-weighted images, and restricted diffusion of water molecules. A hematoma is embedded within, and often intermixed with, tissue or fluid from its site of origin. The final MR appearance is thus a weighted sum of contributions from the hematoma itself as well as background tissues. Hemoglobin and its Derivatives Hemoglobin is comprised of four subunits, each containing a heme group with an iron (Fe) atom nestled at its center. Each Fe center has one free coordination site to which oxygen and other small molecules may transiently bind. Molecular binding creates conformational changes in the Hb molecule and alters its electronic configuration. This, in turn, effects its MR imaging properties, especially at high fields. Four different hemoglobin species are commonly recognized: oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) , deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) , methemoglobin (met-Hb) , and hemichromes , whose structures appear below. The hemoglobin molecule consists of two alpha () and two beta () subunits, each containing an iron-containing heme group to which oxygen (O 2 ) and other small molecules may bind. Transient binding of small molecules to Fe results in chemically and magnetically different Hb species These hemoglobin species typically evolve in the order shown over the first 1-2 weeks after initial hematoma formation. Ultimately, the hemoglobin molecule is enzymatically cleaved into multiple small fragments. Iron atoms are released, but coalesce by the thousands into large, chunky metallo-protein complexes known as ferritin and hemosiderin . Ferritin and hemosiderin are engulfed by invading macrophages and ultimately deposit along the walls of old hematoma cavities. The hemoglobin species above have different electronic structures, resulting in different magnetic susceptibilities () . Oxy-Hb and hemichromes have no unpaired electrons and are weakly diamagnetic. Deoxy-Hb and met-Hb have 4 and 5 unpaired electrons per iron atom respectively and are paramagnetic . Ferritin and hemosiderin form superparamagnetic particles with extremely high magnetic susceptibilities. Evolution of Hematomas on MRI Most of the published literature on the MR imaging of hemorrhage is focused on intracerebral hematomas at high fields (1.5T or higher). These are usually classified by the time frame over which the dominant hemoglobin species is manifest: hyperacute, acute, early subacute, late subacute, and chronic. A summary of imaging finding for each time frame is given below. Hyperacute Hematoma (< 12 hours) When arterial blood extravasates to form a hyperacute hematoma, over 95% of the hemoglobin is in the oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) state. Oxy-Hb has no unpaired electrons, and like most tissues, is weakly diamagnetic. At this stage the MR signal is primarily determined by the microstructural properties of the clot rather than magnetic effects of hemoglobin, with isointensity on T1-weighted images and slight hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Diffusion is restricted in the center of the clot due to increase in viscosity and reduction in extracellular space secondary to packed erythrocytes. Acute Hematoma (12 hours - 2 days) Within a few hours, oxygen begins to to dissociate from the clot's hemoglobin, with increasing formation of deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) . This begins at the periphery of the hematoma and gradually spreads inward. Deoxy-Hb, with 4 unpaired electrons per iron atom, is strongly paramagnetic. Because the deoxy-Hb remains concentrated within RBCs, it produces susceptibility-induced distortions of the local magnetic fields, resulting in dephasing and loss of signal on T2/T2*-weighted images. T1 images remain iso-intense in both the hyperacute and acute stages. Early Subacute Hematoma (2 days - 1 week) Methemoglobin (met-Hb) has 5 unpaired electrons and is even more paramagnetic than its precursor, deoxy-Hb. The configuration of the molecule as a result of iron being in the ferric [Fe(III)] state allows access of water very close to the iron center for the very first time. This allows so-called inner sphere relaxation to occur, resulting in very short T1 values (and corresponding brightness on T1-weighted images). Because met-Hb continues to be compartmentalized intracellularly, however, local magnetic susceptibility effects persist and the hematoma remains dark on T2/T2*-weighted images. Late Subacute Hematoma (1 week - 2 months) Late in the first week lysis of RBCs occurs and met-Hb now spills into the extracellular space. The release of met-Hb from its intracellular compartment eliminates the local susceptibility-induced T2/T2* dephasing, so its signal now becomes bright on T2-weighted images. The molecule itself remains intact, with 5 unpaired electrons, inner-sphere bonding of water and high signal on T1-weighted images. Chronic Hematoma (> 2 months) The final stages of hemoglobin degradation include transformation to hemichromes that have lost all paramagnetic properties. Hemichromes, along with other protein fragments and hemoglobin breakdown products are dissolved/suspended in water (with long T1 and T2 values) in the central residual cavity of the old hematoma. Around the periphery of the cavity, thousands of iron atoms are scavenged by macrophages and glial cells into aggregates know as ferritin and hemosiderin . Ferritin and hemosiderin are superparamagnetic , with powerful susceptibility effects resulting in marked shortening of T2 and T2* along the walls of the old hematoma cavity.

J -coupling is an interaction transmitted through electron clouds in which one nuclear spin perturbs the spin of another in the same molecule. Two types of J -coupling are seen in phosphorus spectroscopy: homonuclear (between two adjacent P nuclei) and heteronuclear (between nearby P and H nuclei). As described in a prior Q&A , J -coupling produces spectral line-splitting. The magnitude of the splitting is given by the coupling constant (J) which is measured in Hz. A good example of homonuclear J -coupling can be seen in the ATP molecule, where the coupling constant between adjacent P nuclei is a respectable 16 Hz. This results in a visually apparent splitting of the  - and  -peaks into doublets by coupling with the P-nucleus at the  -position. Heteronuclear coupling between P and H is often more subtle and insidious as the J P-H coupling constants are relatively small (<3-5 Hz). Discrete line splitting is hard to observe and the coupling appears to broaden the P lines rather than cleave them neatly. Removing this coupling between P and H (a process known as proton decoupling ) will thereby improve the quality of the spectra as illustrated below. P brain spectra with and without H decoupling. \"Membrane peaks\" are especially affected: PME is increased in amplitude with improved resolution into Phosphoryethanolamine (PE) and phosphorylcholine (PC); PDE peak resolved into GPE (glycerophosphoethanolamine) and GPC (glycerophosphocholine);  -ATP doublet better resolved with NAD now seen on shoulder. H-decoupling is performed by applying RF-irradiation at the H Larmor frequency only during the period when the P signal is being recorded. The decoupling irradiation causes each H nucleus to change its state rapidly and lose memory/reference to the state of its coupled P partner. The effect is instantaneous and disappears as soon as the decoupling irradiation is turned off. Two decoupling methods are widely available: Continuous wave decoupling . Narrow-bandwidth RF-irradiation centered near the H Larmor frequency runs continuously during data acquisition. This must be carefully tuned and is sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities. RF-energy deposition in tissues may be limiting. Broadband decoupling . Instead of using continuous excitation, broadband techniques apply a series short composite pulses that are cleverly phase cycled to disrupt J -coupling. The WALTZ-4 method is currently the most popular. As shown in the example above, proton decoupling is most useful for visualizing and characterizing PDE and PME resonances. If information about these peaks is of interest (as it usually is in brain, liver, kidney, and tumor spectroscopic evaluation), the proton decoupling is required. However, if one is only interested in following the major energy metabolites (such as PCr and ATP), as is often the case in MRS of the heart or skeletal muscle, then proton decoupling may not be beneficial.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/decoupling.html"}

The usual Inversion Recovery sequence begins with a 180-inverting pulse, which reverses the longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) for all tissues. During the inversion time (TI) interval, these M z 's regrow via T1-relaxation seeking to restore their equilibrium alignment in the + z -direction. A spin echo (or more commonly a fast spin echo) sequence then generates a signal based on the longitudinal magnetization of each tissue at time TI . If a tissue happens to have longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) close to zero at the end of the TI interval, that tissue will produce little or no signal and make no significant contribution to the magnitude-reconstructed IR image. The tissue is said to be \"nulled\" or \"suppressed\". The value of TI where this happens is known as the \" null point \" or \"zero-crossing point\" and denoted TI null . TI null depends on the ratio TR/T1 and whether the signal is generated by a conventional spin echo (CSE) or Fast/Turbo spin echo (FSE) mechanism. Two equations can be derived Note that when TR>>T1, the equations both reduce to TI null = T1  (ln 2)  0.69 x T1. At 1.5T and assuming a very long TR ( 4000 ms), TI null values for fat, white matter, and gray matter are approximately 180, 400, and 650 ms respectively. Because tissue T1 increases with field strength, these values must be adjusted upward if performing imaging at 3.0T or higher. The T1 value of CSF and other pure liquids is extremely long (on the order of 3000-4000 ms), so usually the simplifying condition TR>>T1 is not met. Additionally since most modern clinical IR imaging uses FSE signal generation with as many as 16-32 echoes, the time of the last echo ( TE last ) also cannot not be ignored. Thus TI null for CSF is not a single number but depends on the precise TR and TE last values chosen.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ti-to-null-a-tissue.html"}

RF Architecture and Coils for P Spectroscopy All hardware components in the RF system must be tuned and matched to the P Larmor frequency (which is only 40% of the H frequency). Accordingly, a complete second radiofrequency (RF) \"front end\" is required for phosphorus spectroscopy, adding considerable cost and complexity to the system. Although \"P-only\" surface coils are still occasionally used, most centers employ coils sensitive to both P and H resonances. Such dual-tuned coils come in flat, wrap-around, and birdcage versions. They may be be receive-only or transmit-receive. Dual-tuned coils are not trivial to construct as inductive interaction between the two components occurs, making it difficult to design a coil that functions optimally for both nuclei. Dual-tuned P-H transmit-receive birdcage head coil (from rapidbiomed.com) Advantages of dual-tuned coils include: 1) ability to perform combined P and H spectroscopy without moving the patient; and 2) improved shimming, anatomic localization, and voxel placement, all of which must be performed using H (because the P signal is too weak). P Spectroscopic Imaging Sequences Compared to the target molecules for H spectroscopy, P metabolites generate much smaller signals and have relatively shorter T2 relaxation times. Their signals are even further reduced due to J -coupling modulations by nearby H nuclei. Accordingly, P MRS is optimized by using pulse sequences with very short TE values. PRESS-based sequences, the workhorses of H spectroscopy, are not typically used for P MRS as their minimum TE's are too long. Several P methods are in common use: Non-localized FID . Also known as \"pulse and acquire\", this method uses an RF-pulse with FID recording and surface coil sensitivity profile to determine the volume of interest. Most commonly used for musculoskeletal spectroscopy. Single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) . Localization using ISIS (or sometimes STEAM) technique. 2D or 3D Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) . Generally incorporates a non-selective (broadband) RF pulse with phase-encoding localization and recording of FIDs. Ancillary Signal Enhancement Techniques P spectral peaks are intrinsically small due to low nuclear sensitivity. Their magnitude is even further reduced from line splitting due to J -coupling with nearby H nuclei. Two ancillary methods involving selective RF-irradiation of H nuclei are commonly used in P spectroscopy to improve signal quality. Proton Decoupling . Unwanted J -coupling interactions can be disrupted by applying RF-pulses tuned to the H frequency during the period of signal acquisition. Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) . If selective H RF-excitation is applied in the period before spectroscopic signal acquisition, the NOE effect can boost the signal from certain P metabolites as much as 50-100%.

The term partial flip angle refers to the use of RF-pulses that tip the longitudinal magnetization some fraction of 90 (e.g., 10, 45). Partial flip angle pulses are used widely in association with GRE techniques to minimize signal loss from saturation effects, as well as to provide a means for obtaining interesting new tissue contrasts. They are also used in some advanced spin echo applications as well as many MRA sequences. The figure (right) demonstrates how a partial flip angle pulse creates an appreciable transverse magnetization while disturbing the longitudinal magnetization only slightly. From trigonometric identities we see that when a magnetization vector M initially aligned with the z -axis is flipped by angle , the transverse and longitudinal components of magnetization after the flip will be [ M sin  ] and [ M cos  ], respectively. For example, a 15-RF pulse acting on M creates an appreciable transverse component of size [ M sin 15 ] = 0.26 M , while reducing the longitudinal magnetization only 3% to [ M cos 15 ] = 0.97 M . Partial flip angle pulse The fact that the longitudinal magnetization has been largely preserved means that little saturation has occurred, and the next RF-pulse will still have a large reservoir of magnetization from which to generate a signal. This advantage is particularly important when TR is short (i.e., < 100 msec). For short TR sequences a significantly stronger MR signal may be obtained by using partial flip angle (rather than 90) pulses.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/partial-flip-angles.html"}

Phosphorus (P) is the second most commonly used nucleus for biological MRS studies. Interest in phosphorus derives from the unique information it provides, including: (1) the composition of cell membranes; (2) bioenergetics and oxidative phosphorylation; and 3) intracellular pH and magnesium levels. Phosphorus has only one naturally occurring stable isotope, P, which like H has spin =  and thus two discrete energy states. The gyromagnetic ratio (  ) of P is 17.2 MHz/T, resulting in a resonance frequency about 60% lower than that of H. Unlike H NMR where the same radiofrequency (RF) front-end architecture can be used for both spectroscopy and imaging, P requires a separate set of RF coils and amplifiers tuned to this lower resonance frequency. The nuclear sensitivity and concentration of P metabolites is also significantly lower than for H, resulting in a weaker signal. Nevertheless, it is still relatively easy to obtain good quality phosphorus spectra with relatively sharp peaks, even at 1.5T. Special techniques such as Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE) can also be employed to increase P signal-to-noise. Compared to H , the number of uniquely identifiable spectral peaks for P is relatively small (<10). Additionally, the chemical shift (  ) range of common phosphorus metabolites exceeds 25 ppm (about 6-fold larger than the range for H), meaning that P peaks are more widely separated. Finally, competing resonances from water and fat protons that contaminate H spectra pose no problem for P spectroscopy. However, scalar (J)-coupling interactions between nearby H and P nuclei do occur, splitting the spectral lines of phosphorus metabolites and reducing their intensities. To counteract this effect decoupling is commonly performed, in which RF-pulses tuned to the H nuclei are applied during MR signal acquisition. A summary of some differences between H and P MR spectroscopy is provided in the table below.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-phosphorus.html"}

Machines \"optimize themselves\" by updating the weights and biases of neural network components during training through the following steps: Forward Pass: Training input data is fed through the neural network, passing though in a forward direction while undergoing a set of linear transformations and non-linear activations to produce one or more outputs. Loss Calculation : The difference between the ideal predicted and measured value of each output is quantified by the Loss Function , introduced in a prior Q&A . Gradient Descent and Back-Propagation . The gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network is computed using the chain rule of calculus. This gradient represents the steepest slope of the loss function at each node. The gradient is calculated by propagating the error backwards through the network, layer by layer, starting from the output layer to the input layer. Weight Update: The weights and biases in the network are adjusted by moving them in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function. This is done by subtracting a small fraction of the gradient from the current values of the weights and biases. The fraction of the gradient that is subtracted is known as the learning rate , which determines how large the weight updates are. Repeat : Steps 1 to 4 are repeated for multiple epochs or iterations until the network converges to a minimum value of the loss function. Gradient Descent The third step in the optimization procedure, Gradient Descent , involves planning the most efficient path to minimize the loss function after each set of training data has been input into the system. This procedure has been likened to finding one's way down a mountain in the fog. At each point you search locally to see where the slope downward is steepest, then take a step in that direction and repeat. Eventually you will hopefully find your way to the bottom of the mountain and obtain the lowest global value for the loss function. Occasionally, however, you may get stuck on a flat part of the mountain (where the slope is zero in all directions) or settle into an intermediate valley (a local minimum). To reduce computational burden several variations of the method have been developed, the most popular being stochastic gradient descent (that uses a randomly selected regional subset of the data rather than computing an exact slope/derivative at every point) and its variant Adam (that includes Ada ptive m oment estimation). Loss function represented in 3 dimensions. The network begins at the solid black circle with a relatively high error rate (loss). Numerical differentiation (ie, calculation of gradient/slope) of the loss function with respect to various parameter weights identifies the local path of steepest descent. At each point along the descent a new steepest gradient is calculated and the descent path modified until a minimum is reached. A specific algorithm, back-propagation, updates network weights and biases sequentially from back to front. The details of this process are somewhat complicated, but involve use of the chain rule (from calculus) to allow gradient weights to calculated and updated one layer at a time. Once the output layer errors are calculated, the errors are propagated backward through the network. At each layer, the error is multiplied by the derivative of the activation function with respect to the weighted sum of the inputs. This gives the error at the weighted sum of the inputs to each node. The following video serves as a useful introduction to this process.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/back-propagation.html"}

In the approximately 70 years since Bloch's original description, considerable progress has been made in explaining the physical mechanisms responsible for T1 and T2 relaxation. We now have reasonably comprehensive theories that explain relaxation in water, simple solutions of salts and proteins, paramagnetic ions, and relatively homogenous solid materials (such as collagen, lipids, and macromolecules). Biological tissues, however, are infinitely more complex, with internal microstructures containing water and larger molecules distributed nonuniformly and within compartments. As such, no comprehensive quantitative theory has yet been developed that easily explains, for example, why liver or brain have the specific T1 and T2 values that they do. Nevertheless, much insight can still be gained by understanding the six basic mechanisms responsible for relaxation in simpler substances. PRINCIPAL RELAXATION MECHANISMS Dipole-dipole interactions Chemical shift anisotropy Molecular translation/flow/diffusion Chemical exchange Scalar (J-coupling) Electric-Quadrupole coupling Below are very brief summaries of the major mechanisms underlying T1 and T2 relaxation. These will be more completely flushed out in subsequent Q&A's. Dipole-Dipole Interaction: The dominant mechanism for  H relaxation As described in a previous Q&A the electromagnetic field from a particle can be considered to emanate from an idealized tiny bar magnet with north and south poles (the \" dipole \"). For our purposes the term dipole is synonymous with either a nucleus (proton) or an unpaired electron. A dipole-dipole interaction is a \"through space\" interaction of the fields from two such spinning particles. If the spins reside on the same molecule it is called an intramolecular dipolar interaction; if on different molecules an intermolecular interaction. Through-space interaction of the magnetic fields of two nearby \"dipoles\" (protons or electrons). Static field distortions contribute to T2 relaxation. Molecular motion of each spin near the Larmor frequency causes local magnetic field fluctuations with both T1 and T2 relaxation. The effectiveness of a dipole-dipole interaction at producing relaxation depends on 1) the types of spins; 2) their spatial relationship; and 3) their relative motion. Electrons are more powerful at inducing relaxation than protons, so proton-electron (or ion) interactions result in much greater relaxation than proton-proton interactions. The dipolar interaction scales inversely with the sixth power of distance between the dipoles; so intramolecular interactions are much more effective than intermolecular ones. Finally, molecular motion (primarily rotation rates) of the dipoles compared to the Larmor frequency determines the degree of relaxation and whether T1 or T2 effects predominate. All of these ideas will be more completely explored in several later Q&A's. Chemical Shift Anisotropy Electron clouds in molecules provide shielding of nuclei from the full intensity of an externally applied magnetic field ( B o ). The resonance frequencies of H nuclei will vary slightly depending on shielding in their local molecular environments. This is known as a chemical shift and forms the basis for MR Spectroscopy . Electron clouds provide variable shielding of nuclei from the effects of the external field (Bo). Electronegative atoms (like oxygen) attract electrons deshielding other atoms. The resonance frequencies of different nuclei vary slightly depending on their local molecular environments. Chemical shift depends upon the orientation of the molecule relative to B o . If the chemical shift varies significantly in different directions, chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) is said to exist. If the molecule is rapidly tumbling (in solution, for example), directional asymmetries average out and CSA is not important. If the molecule is restricted in its motion (such as water complexed to a macromolecule), then CSA effects may be important. This phenomenon could partially explain the paradoxically shorter T2 values observed in biological tissues than would be predicted from their molecular rotation rates alone. CSA also explains the short T2 of tendons which are composed of Type I collagen oriented in parallel bundles. CSA relaxation scales with the square of field strength ( B o ), so is more important at higher fields. It is also important in the imaging and spectroscopy of the phosphorus (P) nucleus that has exceptionally large chemical shifts relative to its resonance frequency. Molecular Translation / Flow / Diffusion Any physical process that causes a molecule to move between different local environments during the course of an MR experiment can result in relaxation. The displacement may be due to translation of the molecule by a chemical, electrical, or gravitational gradient. It might be an organized, en masse displacement of many molecules, as in blood or CSF flow . Or it might be an entirely random process due to microscopic diffusion , the thermally-induced displacements of molecules due to Brownian motion. Diffusion of water molecules through a local magnetic field gradient due to a susceptibility disturbance. If the external magnetic field through which a translating (or flowing or diffusing) molecule is uniform, then the nucleus' resonance frequency will remain constant and no relaxation will occur. If the external field is not uniform, however, then the nucleus will resonate at different frequencies and develop a random phase shifts as it moves, resulting in loss of transverse coherence. Such local field nonuniformities are typically due to susceptibility -generated gradients on a macroscopic (e.g., near metallic foreign bodies or air-tissue interfaces) or microscopic (e.g due to paramagnetic ions, microcalcifications, or hemosiderin deposits) basis. Translation/flow/diffusion results primarily in T2 relaxation proportional to the square of the gradient field and the length of time the spin moves within that gradient. It should be noted that in MR Angiography (MRA) and Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) , additional external strong gradients are often applied to create enhanced sensitivity to flow or diffusion. These external gradients are not considered causes of true-T2 relaxation since they do not derive from intrinsic, natural processes and have no effect on stationary spins. Chemical Exchange Chemical exchange Hydrogen atoms are frequently involved in chemical exchange processes, wherein they are physically transferred from one molecule to another. Alternatively, the hydrogen proton may undergo a \"chemical exchange equivalent\" by residing on a molecule that changes its structure or moves between chemically different compartments in a tissue (e.g., from inside to outside of a cell). Relaxation rates produced by chemical exchange processes are proportional to the square of the applied magnetic field. Scalar (J)-Coupling Scalar- or J-Coupling is an interaction of two nuclear spins on the same molecule transmitted through distortions in electron clouds. This contrasts with dipole-dipole interactions that occur via direct electromagnetic interactions \"through space\" and do not require an electron cloud intermediary. Scalar (J)-coupling interaction between two nuclei is mediated by the electron clouds they share. Overall J-coupling plays a relatively minor role in determining the overall relaxation properties of tissues. It is independent of field strength and generally has a much larger effect on T2 than T1 relaxation. Some of its effects can be seen in clinical MR, however. For example, J-coupling interactions are responsible for the splitting of chemical peaks (such as the famous lactate doublet) seen in MR Spectroscopy. Additionally, J-coupling is responsible for a time-dependent modulation of the MR signal from fat on spin-echo images. Electric-Quadrupole Coupling Quadrupolar coupling is an extremely powerful and the dominant relaxation mechanism for nuclei (such as Na) with spin quantum numbers (I) >  . Such nuclei possess nonspherical charge distributions (quadrupolar moments). They interact powerfully with electric (rather than magnetic) field gradients in surrounding electron clouds, resulting in unequal splitting of the quadrupolar energy levels. I =  nuclei like H have spherical charge distributions so do not relax by this mechanism. Nuclei with I  1 have a nonspherical (ellipsoidal) charge distribution and interact with nearby electrical fields. Even though the mean distance (d) between the quadrupolar nucleus and the lone charge (+) does not change, nuclear orientation effects the energy levels and causes relaxation.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/causes-of-relaxation.html"}

In previous Q&A's we have introduced the concept of spin angular momentum (I) or simply \"spin\" , an intrinsic magnetic property possessed by nuclei and subatomic particles. We saw that spin varies by nuclear species as I assumes whole or half integer values between 0 and 8. The H nucleus, a single proton, has I = , the lowest possible non-zero value allowed for spin . In the subatomic world governed by quantum mechanics, nuclei are better thought of as fuzzy \"probability waves\" rather than solid \"objects\". Because of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , we cannot know the exact direction of a particle's spin at any point in time. However, we can measure and know with certainty some limited properties about the spin, such as a component of its angular momentum along a single direction . Such a physically measurable quantity is known as an eigenvalue corresponding to a particle's pure spin state or eigenstate . (In German, the word \"eigen\" means \"own\" or \"self\"). The number of eigenstates (or pure spin states ) for a nucleus with spin = I is given by: Number of nuclear spin states = 2 I + 1 Hence for the H nucleus with I = , there are 2() + 1 = 2 possible spin states. Note that nuclei with higher values of I may have more than a dozen spin states, but for now we will just consider the two spin states of H. These states are commonly denoted as  + and  - often referred to as \"spin-up or \"parallel\" and spin-down or \"anti-parallel\" respectively. The implications of these alternate terms will become apparent shortly. In the absence of an external magnetic field, the two separate spin states for hydrogen are not observable and said to be degenerate . If an external magnetic field ( B o ) is applied, however, a quantum-field interaction occurs allowing the two separate states to be measured/revealed. Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach performed a famous experiment demonstrating this phenomenon in 1922. Spin- silver atoms were boiled off from an oven, passed between the poles of a strong magnet, and then allowed to deposit on a glass plate. Instead of a single smear of silver corresponding to all possible spin orientations, exactly two silver spots were detected. The atoms had apparently sorted themselves into \"spin up\" and \"spin down\" states as they passed through the field. This is perhaps the most tangible proof of the quantization of angular momentum that can be made to appear in the macroscopic world. Memorial plaque in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany near entrance to the building where Stern and Gerlach performed their famous experiment. Diagram of Stern-Gerlach experiment. Silver atoms (spin= ) boiled from an oven and passed through a magnet deposited in two spots (instead of one), corresponding to spin-up and spin-down states separated by the magnetic field. It should be emphasized that just because a nucleus has two spin states, it does not mean that the individual spins reside exclusively in one state or the other. Most modern interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest that they do not. In fact, nearly all spins exist in a weighted superposition of both states simultaneously! In experimental settings (such as being passed through the S-G apparatus) their pure eigenstates can become physically manifest. Whether this is best explained by Copenhagen, Many Worlds, or other model I will leave to the philosophers of science. The physical separation in the deposition of silver atoms by the Stern-Gerlach apparatus also reflects an energy difference (  ) between the two states. This is known as the nuclear Zeeman effect , named after Pieter Zeeman, who in 1896 had observed the splitting of optical spectral lines by a magnetic field. This topic will be discussed in more detail in the next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/spin-vs-spin-state.html"}

MRA methods can be divided into two broad categories depending on whether they produce dark blood or bright blood. Bright blood techniques are further subdivided according to whether they are performed with or without gadolinium contrast. Classification of MRA techniques Abbreviations: FSE = fast spin echo, IR = inversion recovery, SWI = susceptibility weighted imaging, TOF = time-of-flight, PC = phase contrast, SSFP = steady-state free precession, ASL = arterial spin labelling Dark blood MRA (SWI) Bright blood MRA (TOF) Dark Blood MRA Dark (\"black\") blood MRA techniques suppress signal from flowing blood while maintaining high signal in the surrounding stationary tissues, thus rendering the vessels black. The dark blood effect may be achieved by accentuating flow-related dephasing or exploiting the T1 and T2 properties of blood. Flow saturation pulses can also be used with any of these techniques to further to suppress intravascular signal. Fast Spin Echo (FSE) Black Blood MRA . FSE black blood techniques depend primarily on the phenomenon of flow-related signal loss (also known as the \"washout\" effect ), with additional contributions from spin-dephasing , all described in a prior Q&A . The classic vascular \" flow void \" seen on routine MR imaging is a crude form of black-blood MRA that derives from these same phenomena. Inversion Recovery (IR) Black Blood MRA . Single, double, or even triple 180 -inversion pulses may be used to suppress the signal from blood and other tissues (such as fat or myocardium) based on their respective T1 values. At 1.5T inversion times ( TI ) of 500-700 msec are used to null the signal from blood. Black blood IR methods are most commonly used for cardiac and vessel wall imaging. Susceptibility-weighted (SW) Black Blood MRA . Although more commonly used for the detection of calcification and hemorrhage, SW imaging was originally developed as a black blood venography technique. The paramagnetic effects of deoxyhemoglobin (present in high concentrations in venous blood) significantly shortens T2 and T2* in the vicinity of veins. 3D gradient echo sequences with long TE values are used to accentuate T2* dephasing, and the images displayed with a minimum intensity projection algorithm. Bright Blood MRA Contrast-enhanced MRA methods require rapid injection of a gadolinium-based agent through a large peripheral vein. Paramagnetic contrast shortens the relaxation times of blood, rendering vessels bright on T1-weighted images. After circulating through the heart, a set of images is rapidly acquired through the area of interest. The signal from background tissue is often removed by a subtraction technique. Like its close cousin, CT angiography, contrast-enhanced MRA derives its heightened intravascular signal purely from the presence of contrast material and does not depend on MR-based flow phenomena. Non-contrast MRA methods, by comparison, are based entirely on the MR properties of flowing blood, including its intrinsic relaxation times, time-of-flight (TOF), and spin-phase effects. Several variations are possible: Time-of-Flight (TOF) MRA . These methods exploit the inflow-enhancement effect described in a prior Q&A . Here, fully magnetized blood emits a high signal when it flows into a volume of stationary tissue that has been magnetically saturated by rapidly repeated RF-pulses. TOF MRA is among the oldest and most popular methods of non-contrast MRA Phase-contrast (PC) MRA . Phase-contrast techniques exploit spin-phase effects that have been more completely discussed in a prior Q&A . As protons flow through a magnetic field gradient, they gain or lose phase compared to stationary background tissue. This phase change may be translated into an angiographic image. Because phase shift is directly related to blood flow, PC methods are widely used to measure vascular and CSF flow. Steady-state Free Precession (SSFP) MRA . Balanced SSFP techniques like TrueFISP are emerging as important methods for noncontrast MRA of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. High intravascular signal results from the intrinsically large T2/T1 ratio of blood compared to that of solid tissues. Fast Spin Echo (FSE) MRA . This method obtains cardiac-gated FSE images in systole and diastole. During diastole, the signal in both arteries and veins is high reflecting the long T2 of blood. During systole, venous signal remains high but arterial signal drops due to flow-related signal loss. Subtraction of the systolic from the diastolic images results in a pure arterial image. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRA . In ASL methods upstream spins (which subsequently flow into the imaged volume) are first \"tagged\" with a 180-inversion pulse. Background tissue is suppressed either by a subtraction method requiring two acquisitions or by applying a spatially nonselective pulse to the imaged volume in a single acquisition. ASL techniques can be combined with SSFP or FSE methods for an enhanced effect. Each of these basic MRA methods will be described in detail in subsequent Q&A's. Many variations and combinations are possible.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mra-methods.html"}

Any periodically oscillating sinusoidal wave (or simple MR signal) has three fundamental properties: amplitude, frequency, and phase. These properties are explicitly apparent in the mathematical formulation for a sine wave: S ( t ) = A sin(  o t  ) where S ( t ) is the signal as a function of time, A is the amplitude,  o is the angular frequency, and  is the instantaneous phase. By adjusting these factors, the appearance of the sine wave can be varied. Instantaneous phase (  ) represents an angular shift between two sine waves and is measured in radians (or degrees). A sine wave and a cosine wave are 90  (  /2 radians) out of phase with each other. After a period of time, t, two sine waves initially synchronized in phase but differing in frequency by  radians per second will develop a differential total phase shift () given by:  =   t. Or in more general terms expressed by calculus:  =  (t) dt where  is the total phase shift accumulated over a period of time (t) and  ( t ) is the frequency shift that may vary as a function of time. The total accumulated phase shift () can be thought of as the area under a frequency vs time curve. This fact will prove useful when we discuss the phase changes induced by gradients or flow in later Q&A's. If you still don't quite understand why (frequency x time) = phase, think about the units of measurement. Frequency is commonly measured in Hertz, or cycles per second. Time is measured in seconds. So frequency x time = (cycles/sec) x sec = # of cycles. Thus two sine waves differing in frequency by 200 Hz get progressively out of phase with each other by 200 cycles every second. To understand the more complex aspects of frequency and phase encoding of the MR image, it is necessary to review what happens when two sine waves are added together. If two sine waves have the same frequency but different phases, their summation is another sine wave with the same base frequency but a different amplitude and phase. When the two waves are perfectly in phase with each other, their signals augment each other. When they are slightly out of phase with each other, the overall signal is diminished, and they are said to destructively interfere. When the phase shift between them reaches 180, the two waves exactly cancel each other. Summation of two sine waves of the same frequency but different phases. As   180 (out-of-phase condition) the two waves destructively interfere, yielding a net signal that is nearly zero. (Click on image to animate.

The main purpose of breast H-MRS is to help distinguish benign from malignant tumors. Numerous reports have described the association of cancer with elevation of a broad spectral peak centered at approximately  = 3.2 ppm. This peak is primarily derived from free choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine and is commonly referred to as total choline (tCho) . Several other compounds including taurine, glucose, phophoethanolamine, and myoinositol also make minor contributions to this resonance. Single voxel breast MRS study showing elevated total choline (tCho) in a malignant neoplasm. Note commonly seen contamination from incompletely suppressed lipids. (Modified from image courtesy of Siemens) Breast MRS is technically challenging. The nature of breast masses is that they are frequently multiple, relatively small, spaced widely apart, and embedded in a background of fat. For these reasons breast MRS is less widely used clinically than brain or even prostate MRS at present. Although 2D and 3D CSI methods are possible, the overwhelming majority of published studies in breast cancer have utilized SVS techniques. Accurate sizing and placement of the voxel is critical, with special care needed to exclude both adipose tissues and cystic/necrotic regions. Although gadolinium contrast may reduce the size of the choline peak, it is still commonly used to identify small lesions and to define tumor margins before spectroscopy. Prior to generating spectra, automated plus manual shimming to achieve water line widths of no greater than 20 (for 1.5T) and 30 Hz (for 3.0T) must be performed. A typical SVS protocol might be: SVS-PRESS, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 135 ms, and NEX = 128 using 1024 data points. Fat and water suppression is required using conventional CHESS (or more sophisticated MEGA) pulses. Intermediate to long TE values (i.e.,130-288 ms) are recommended to allow the signal from fat to decay and render the tCho peak more conspicuous.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/breast-mrs.html"}
{"id": "e42c84bb-fb21-45a5-8e6c-b5ccf81b4db9", "contents": "Effect of Shape I don't understand how an object's shape affects its magnetization. You are not alone. The effect of object shape is far more complex than most people have ever imagined! Diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or weakly ferromagnetic materials Objects composed of materials with small susceptibilities (i.e.,  < 1 ), including most surgical stainless steels and non-ferrous metals such as tin, aluminum, copper, or lead are only minimally displaced by an external magnetic field and pose no dangers as projectiles. Any shape effects on their magnetization are largely irrelevant and may be disregarded. Moderately to strongly ferromagnetic materials Objects made of iron, nickel, and/or chromium with larger susceptibilities (  >> 1 ) become progressively magnetized when placed in an external magnetic field ( B o ). As the external field increases, so does this internal polarization/ magnetization ( M ) as electron spins begin to align and magnetic domain boundaries are reshaped. This process continues until M reaches the magnetic saturation point of the material, beyond which no further magnetization can occur. ( Note that the magnetic polarization M arises from electron spins in microscopic currents and has nothing to do with nuclear magnetization M discussed elsewhere ). Ferromagnetic materials, when placed in an external field ( B o ), develop a strong internal magnetization ( M ), behaving like little magnets themselves. Their edges exposed to the external field become like north and south poles, with a resultant internal demagnetizing field ( D ), that opposes M . As a result of this process, an object composed of moderate to strongly ferromagnetic material essentially becomes its own \"little magnet\" whose ends can be thought of as north and south \"poles\". These \"poles\" represent an accumulation of imputed magnetic charge density at the ends of the object where there is an abrupt magnetic field discontinuity (i.e., where M goes from a positive value inside the object to zero immediately outside). An internal demagnetizing field (D) is thereby created, running from the object's north to south poles opposite to the direction both M and B o . Provided the object is homogeneous and responds linearly to small magnetic field changes, the demagnetizing field ( D ) is generally assumed to be proportional to M in each direction, related by a constant of proportionality between 0 and 1 known as the demagnetization factor (N) . Specifically, D =  N M. By opposing B o , D reduces the effective magnetic field inside the object, but because of its relatively small size, does not significantly affect M . The volume magnetic susceptibility (  ) , defined as the ratio between M and the field intensity, is correspondingly reduced to an apparent susceptibility (  app ) given by Note that for strongly ferromagnetic materials (those with  >> 1), the dependence on  disappears, leaving  app = 1/N as an approximation. An important corollary of this result is that for a ferromagnetic material, the external field strength (B ext ) needed to reach critical magnetic saturation (B sat ) is much smaller than expected. Specifically, Consider, for example, a sphere of silicon steel with B sat = 2.0 T brought near a 1.5 T MR scanner. The demagnetization factor for a sphere is  in each direction, so the sphere will become completely magnetized when the external field (B ext ) reaches N  B sat = ()(2.0) = 0.67 T. Surprisingly, the sphere has reached its full (2.0T) saturation magnetization while still in the fringe field of the 1.5T scanner! Actually this should not come as too big a surprise because the common layman's description of ferromagnetic materials is that they tend to \"concentrate\" the lines of external magnetic fields thereby increasing magnetic flux density within them. In general N and  are not a single numbers, but 2nd order tensors (arrays of values corresponding to different directions). For symmetric 3-D forms like ellipsoids, it is possible to select a coordinate frame aligned with the principal axes of the body resulting in three demagnetizing factors , N x , N y , and N z , corresponding to each cardinal direction. These are all dimensionless numbers between 0 and 1, having the additional property N x + N y + N z = 1. Predicting Demagnetizing Factor(s) The demagnetizing field ( D ) is strongly dependent on the shape and orientation of the ferromagnetic object in the external field. Calculation of D for a given object typically requires extensive computer simulations, but a few exact solutions are possible for simple geometric shapes. Below are computed demagnetization factors (N) in the B o -direction . What trends do you notice? Demagnetizing factors ( N ) along the direction of the main field for various simple homogeneous objects. Note that objects with the highest N -values are those that have a large relative surface area facing in the direction of Bo . Such an object is typified by the thin vertical plate perpendicular to Bo , which has N  1.00 (the highest possible value). Conversely, when the plate is turned by 90, N  0.00 (the lowest possible value). The same principle is demonstrated by the various ellipsoids and cylinders illustrated. So why does this occur? The reason is that for relatively thin objects with their largest areas facing B o , the virtual north and south poles on their surfaces are close together; hence the demagnetizing field ( D ) is very strong. Conversely, when the virtual poles are far apart (as in the light blue cylinder pointing parallel to B o ), the poles at the ends are very far apart. In this scenario, the interior N-S pairs cancel each other out leaving widely separated magnetic charge densities only at the two ends. This orientation of the cylinder thus results in a very weak demagnetizing field ( D ) and correspondingly small value for the demagnetizing factor ( N z ). Further information about demagnetizing factors and derivation of the equations above can be found in the Advanced Disccusion.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/object-shape.html"}

In the previous Q&A we showed how molecular motion of two dipoles could create locally fluctuating magnetic fields resulting in T1 and/or T2 relaxation. A somewhat different way to look at the dipole-dipole interaction with a quantum mechanical bent involving energy levels is presented below. This analysis provides equivalent final results but slightly different insights. Consider the system of two spins shown below, which might be the two hydrogen protons on a water molecule (HOH). Depending on the initial orientations of the spins, several different outcomes may result. Most of these outcomes result in energy exchange and hence both T1 and T2 relaxation; other outcomes do not result in a net change in energy and T2 relaxation only. In the diagram right I have shown two spins (nuclei/protons) in pure \"spin-up\" or \"spin-down\" states separated by energy quanta ( = hf o ). This has been done for simplicity/clarity only. As stated many times elsewhere on this site, spins are not restricted to these absolute orientations, but by doing so here the reasoning will hopefully be made easier to follow. Let us first assume one nucleus comes into the interaction in the pure \"spin-up\" state and the other begins in the pure \"spin-down\" state. The interaction between the two may cause only a single nucleus to change state, resulting in either two \"spin-up\" nuclei or two \"spin-down\" nuclei. In either case, an energy transfer at the Larmor frequency will have occurred resulting in T1 (and therefore also T2) relaxation. From this new {up-up} or {down-down} condition, a double transition is now possible, with both spins simultaneously changing to the opposite paired state. Such a double transition also involves energy exchange and results in both T1 and T2 relaxation. An interesting interaction is seen in the middle of the diagram below, where an initially {up-down} pair of spins interacts resulting where both flip resulting in a final {down-up} state for the system. This is known as a \" flip-flop \". Although one spin has gained energy and the other lost energy, no net change in total system energy has occurred and hence no T1 relaxation. However, the interaction has randomly altered the angular momentum of both spins, so they no longer have any constant phase relationship to each other or to other spins in the sample. Hence, T2 relaxation alone has taken place.

Forms of Hemoglobin Erythrocytes are red due to the presence of hemoglobin (Hb) , the conglomerate macromolecule responsible for oxygen transport. Hemoglobin is composed of four subunits, each consisting of a non-protein heme group surrounded by a coiled protein ( globin ). Each heme group contains of an iron (Fe) ion surrounded by a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. The hemoglobin molecule consists of two alpha () and two beta () subunits, each containing an iron-containing heme group to which oxygen (O 2 ) may bind. The heme group consists of an iron (Fe) ion surrounded by a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. The iron (Fe) center has 6 potential coordination sites, four of which are occupied by porphyrin nitrogens (N). The fifth coordination site (below the plane of the ring) covalently bonds with a histidine (His) residue from the F8 position of its respective globin chain. The sixth coordination site (above the plane of the ring) is where all the \"action\" occurs. This is the place oxygen and other small molecules transiently bind to the iron atom, affecting its electronic structure and magnetic properties. The chemical state of hemoglobin changes sequentially over the first two weeks as a hematoma evolves. Four different hemoglobin species are commonly recognized: oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) , deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) , methemoglobin (met-Hb) , and hemichromes , whose structures appear below. Coordination (bonding) sites for Hb iron Following this evolutionary transition methemoglobin and hemichromes are enzymatically cleaved into multiple small fragments. Iron atoms are released, but coalesce by the thousands into large, chunky metallo-protein complexes known as ferritin and hemosiderin . Ferritin and hemosiderin are engulfed by invading macrophages and ultimately deposit along the walls of the old hematoma cavity. Magnetic Properties of Hemoglobin Derivatives The electronic configuration of iron differs among the various hemoglobin species and is primarily responsible for their overall MR properties. The valence state  ferrous (Fe +2 ) or ferric (Fe +3 )  is irrelevant; what matters is the number of unpaired electrons in the entire molecule. The magnetic susceptibility () is proportional to N(N+2) , where N = the number of unpaired electrons. The T2 relaxation rate, in turn, is proportional to the square of the magnetic susceptibility (  ). # of unpaired electrons is per iron atom for deoxy-Hb and met-Hb, and per molecule for ferritin and hemosiderin The paramagnetic properties of deoxy-Hb, Met-Hb, ferritin, and hemosiderin provide dominant MR image contrast for hematomas imaged at fields over 0.5T, and become increasingly important the higher the field strength.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/types-of-hemoglobin.html"}

Contributions to the total observed signal in a DSC perfusion study: 1st pass of bolus (early) and recirculation effects (late) When gadolinium passes through tissue, T2/T2* dephasing occurs with a concomitant decrease in MR signal intensity. The dominant negative peak primarily reflects 1st pass of the initial bolus through the regional arterial circulation. Almost simultaneously, however, a second wave of gadolinium passes through the tissue that affects the size and timing of the first peak. This second wave represents recirculation of gadolinium-containing blood that has been shunted through the renal and coronary circulations and back into the heart. In addition to affecting the main peak, continued recirculation prevents the DSC signal from returning to its original baseline. Various mathematical techniques are frequently applied to the DSC data to correct or compensate for recirculation effects. One of the most popular methods is to use a gamma variate fitting. The gamma variate function bears resemblance to the red 1st pass arterial curve illustrated above with a relatively sharp initial downslope and a more gradual return to baseline.

Image-Selected In vivo Spectroscopy (ISIS) was developed in the 1980s and probably remains the best single voxel spectroscopy (SVS) for P when using transmit/receive surface coils. The recorded signal is a free induction decay (FID). Similar to PRESS and STEAM, ISIS uses a slice intersection strategy for voxel localization. However, the required spectrum is not obtained from a single acquisition, but must be calculated using data from 8 separate RF-pulse cycles. These FIDs are added and subtracted in a particular order to define the volume of interest. A simplified version of the ISIS sequence is shown below: Simplified pulse-timing diagram of the ISIS sequence The sequence includes three slice-selective 180-inversion pulses and gradients in three orthogonal directions. The 8 separate acquisitions needed to calculate the final ISIS spectrum result from the 2 = 8 permutations of inversion pulses (off/off/off, off/off/ON, off/ON/ON, etc.). The FID in each cycle is obtained using a nonselective (\"hard\") 90-pulse that excites the entire volume under the coil. To better understand how this works in practice, the diagram below shows how a 2-cycle ISIS sequence in one dimension could be used to localize a single planar slab of data. The metabolites of interest in P spectroscopy have relatively short T2 values, and hence ISIS allows capturing more of this signal than either PRESS or STEAM. During the ISIS localization process, the magnetization remains along the longitudinal axis ( z) except during the short readout period of the FID. The major limitations of ISIS result from subtraction errors. These occur primarily due to signal contamination when various portions of the imaged tissue block respond slightly differently to the RF-pulses. Motion artifacts during the 8-cycle acquisition also contribute.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/isis.html"}

Acute hemorrhage is arbitrarily defined to be bleeding between 12 hours and 2 days old. Hemorrhages occurring within the first 12 hours are called hyperacute , while those between 2 days and 2 months old are called subacute . The stage of acute hemorrhage is characterized by robust formation of deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) , the hemoglobin species that has lost oxygen from its heme binding sites. Blood containing substantial quantities of deoxy-Hb is easily recognized by its dark purplish-red color, such as that seen in venous blood samples. Loss of O 2 to form deoxy-Hb results in conformational change of the hemoglobin molecule as well as profound alteration of its magnetic properties. (Image from the RCSB PDB www.rcsb.org; Click to animate). Local field distortions due to deoxy-Hb within RBCs dephases nearby H 2 O molecules, causing loss of signal on T2/T2*-weighted images. Deoxyhemoglobin formation typically begins at the periphery of a hematoma and gradually spreads inward. Deoxy-Hb, with 4 unpaired electrons per iron atom, is strongly paramagnetic . Because it is concentrated within RBCs, deoxy-Hb produces susceptibility-induced distortions of local magnetic fields. As water molecules diffuse past RBCs they encounter field variations on the order of 0.2-0.4 ppm. This results in accelerated dephasing and loss of signal on T2/T2*-weighted images. This marked dephasing due to concentrated deoxy-Hb spills over into diffusion-weighted images, producing the so-called \" T2-blackout effect .\" In reality, diffusion remains restricted in the center of acute hematomas, just as it does in hyperacute ones. However, the expected high signal on DW images representing restricted diffusion is masked by susceptibility-induced signal loss. Although T2 and T2* are significantly shortened by the acute hematoma, T1 values are relatively unaffected. This is because the conformation of the globin proteins do not allow water molecules close access to the paramagnetic centers of deoxy-Hb. Outer sphere relaxation mechanisms predominate, resulting in strong effects on T2 with little or no change in T1 values. Thus, as with hyperacute hemorrhages, T1-weighted images remain isointense to brain.

Hematoma is isointense to brain on T1-weighted image (top left). Center of hematoma is markedly hypointense on T2 (top center) and T2-FLAIR (top right) images. A halo of high signal edema in the surrounding brain is noted. GRE image (bottom left) shows loss of signal due to T2* dephasing from paramagnetic deoxy-Hb confined to RBCs. DW image (bottom center) and ADC map (bottom right) both have dark centers, due to strong paramagnetic artifacts and the T2-blackout effect. Susceptibility artifacts make accurate calculation of ADC values difficult (manifest by specked appearance) Important Note: The discussion above primarily applies to higher field ( 0.5 T) systems where imaging findings are dominated by the paramagnetic effects of hemoglobin. At low and intermediate fields some important differences in imaging appearances are noted. See this Q&A for a more detailed analysis.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/acutedeoxy-hb.html"}

Outer volume suppression bands (yellow) and 3D-CSI grid placed over the prostate. Due to its small size and deep location embedded in pelvic fat, MRS of the prostate is challenging. Both endorectal and pelvic phased-array coils are needed for maximum signal-to-noise. Manual shimming is generally recommended in addition to automated shimming to improve the quality of spectroscopic data acquired. Thin-section, high-resolution, multi-planar T2-weighted images serve both diagnostic purposes and as spectroscopic localizers. Outer volume saturation (OVS) bands should be tightly placed around the gland in all three dimensions to exclude signal from pelvic fat and from fluid in the seminal vesicles.

To generate an MR signal, protons require external stimulation at energies near the resonance frequency. This stimulation comes from an externally positioned radiofrequency (RF) transmit coil. The most common RF-coil design for 3.0T and below is the so-called birdcage coil, a cylindrical structure with multiple rungs. Details about birdcage coil design can be found at this special webpage . Although local transmit RF-coils may be used for head, knee, and small-parts imaging, the bulk of RF transmission for MRI is performed by birdcage-style \"body coils\" located immediately beneath the plastic walls of the scanner. Magnetic fields generated by a head-only RF birdcage coil. Colored circles represent capacitors. (Courtesy of P. Futter, computed with FEKO) Standard RF-transmit body coils are only about 50 cm in length and thus do not extend the entire length of the scanner bore (which may be up to 100 cm long). They are positioned to straddle magnet isocenter and produce strong, uniform excitation within this region. Transmitted power dies out significantly as one moves away from isocenter. For most body coils RF power in the midline is reduced by 50% at z = 15 cm and by 99% at z = 30 cm. Interestingly, and widely unrecognized, is the fact that the RF power can be as much as 3x stronger near the scanner walls in locations immediately adjacent to the coils. Focal \"hot spots\" are present within a few centimeters of the junction of each birdcage rung. These hot spots repeat around the periphery of the magnet bore according to the number of rungs (e.g. 16-32). A patient whose hand, shoulder, or other body part touches the scanner walls (or comes close in these hot spots) is at increased risk of a cutaneous burn. Likewise, a wire or cable passing though the hot spots may be more likely to acquire an induced electric current. Distribution of peak B 1 within the bore of a 3T MR scanner. Note the local RF \"hot spots\" adjacent to the ends of the RF-coil rungs. (Lower half of image courtesy of Dr. E. Kanal, created using the MagnetVision app he created) Transmit-receive coils (e.g. for head and knee) have certain advantages over body transmit coils because their magnetic ( B ) and electric ( E ) fields are more confined and have less effect on non-imaged body parts. This is illustrated in the field plots below calculated for a gel-filled ASTM phantom. Of interest is that the E fields are maximal in the center of each rung whereas the B fields are concentrated at the ends. Calculated electric ( E ) and magnetic ( B ) field plots in the coronal plane for the ASTM phantom using head coil and body coil transmission respectively. Note concentration of B fields near the ends of the rungs while E fields are more evenly distributed along the entire rung.

The oldest and most straightforward way to reduce cardiorespiratory artifacts is to synchronize MR data acquisition to the cardiac or respiratory cycles. This process is known as gating or triggering . The two terms are often used interchangeably. In the strictest sense, however, triggering is a form of prospective gating where MR data acquisition only begins after detection of a desired physiologic event (an R-wave, peripheral pulse, or specified level of inspiration). Gating , a somewhat broader term than triggering , may be either prospective or retrospective. In retrospective gating , MR data are acquired continuously (not in response to a particular cardiorespiratory \"trigger\" event). The EKG, pulse, or respiratory level is recorded simultaneously with the MR data. The MR data can then be reordered, grouped, or correlated with phase of the cardiorespiratory cycle. Retrospective gating is the method typically used for cine-cardiac motion studies. Prospective cardiac gating (triggering) acquires data during a specific acquisition window between R-waves. Retrospective gating collects data continuously then groups and fills k -space according to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Cardiac Gating Cardiac contraction can be detected by EKG or a peripheral pulse transducer. Some type of EKG-based triggering is mandatory for imaging the heart (and often advisable for imaging of the lower thorax). Peripheral pulse gating cannot be used for heart imaging due to the long and unpredictable delay between cardiac contraction and arrival of the pulse wave to the finger. Peripheral pulse gating is commonly used for peripheral MRA and for cine CSF flow studies, however. Peripheral pulse transducer (photoplethysmograph) from www.biopac.com Cardiac and peripheral pulse gating methods are extremely reliable and widely used, except whenever ventricular arrhythmias are present. The methods require special hardware and software plus several minutes of additional setup time before each scan. Another limitation is that the repetition time ( TR ) cannot be freely chosen but must be set to a multiple of the beat-to-beat interval. Respiratory Gating Imaging of the lower chest and upper abdomen requires some method to freeze diaphragmatic motion. In cooperative patients simple breath-holding may be used in conjunction with rapid imaging techniques such as HASTE or SS-EPI. For uncooperative patients and for studies requiring longer than 20-30 seconds (the average patient breath-hold limit) some sort of respiratory gating technique must be used. Pneumatic respiratory belt and transducer (from www.biopac.com) Respiratory expansion may be detected by use of a thoracic belt, bellows, or cushion. The belt should be placed around the lower chest for \"chest breathers\" and around the mid abdomen for \"abdominal breathers\". Impedance plesmythography devices that measure changes in electrical resistance across the chest with respiration also exist but are not commonly used. Simple respiratory gating requires images to be obtained only during limited portions of the respiratory cycle and incurs a significant time penalty (up to 3x that of an ungated study). Hence prospective respiratory gating is seldom used in its pure form any more. Retrospective compensation methods are still performed, however, using methods that collect or reorder image data according to respiratory phase. In recent years the use of navigator echoes to track diaphragmatic motion has become the most popular method for performing respiratory triggering. The images below illustrate the effects of simple prospective cardiac and respiratory gating, alone and in combination, to improve MR images of the chest and upper abdomen.

I don't really understand why this type of motion should occur. Can you explain? Nuclei precess around the magnetic field for essentially the same reasons that tops or gyroscopes precess around a gravitational field: 1) Both gyroscopes and nuclei possess angular momentum . For the gyroscope, angular momentum results from a flywheel rotating about its axis. For the nucleus, angular momentum results from an intrinsic quantum property (spin). 2) Momentum is also sometimes called inertia . Objects possessing momentum have a tendency to maintain their motion unless acted upon by an external force. For example, a speeding truck has a great deal of (linear) momentum and cannot easily be induced to change its speed or direction. Angular momentum behaves similarly, conferring on the nucleus or gyroscope a strong resistance to changing its orientation or direction of rotation. 3) Static gravitational and magnetic fields create a torque or \"twisting force\" acting perpendicular to both the field and the direction of the angular momentum. The gyroscope or nucleus does not \"tip over\" but is instead deflected into a circular path perpendicular to the field. 4) The resultant circular motion is called precession . Precession occurs at a specific frequency denoted either by  o (called the angular frequency , measured in radians/sec) or f o (called the cyclic frequency , measured in cycles/sec or Hertz [Hz]). Since 2 radians = 360 = 1 cycle (revolution), angular and cyclic frequencies can easily be converted by the equation:  o = 2  f o 5) The precession frequency of a gyroscope is a function of the mass and shape of the wheel, the speed of wheel rotation, and the strength of the gravitational field. The precession frequency of a nucleus is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field ( B o ) and the gyromagnetic ratio () , a particle-specific constant incorporating size, mass, and spin. This is embodied in the famous Larmor relationship , given by the equation: f o =  B o As a further introduction to the concept of angular momentum and precession, I strongly suggest viewing the YouTube video of the late Sir Paul Callaghan, a famed New Zealand NMR researcher. Before he died, Dr. Callahan posted an excellent set of 10 short videos on the internet demonstrating the basic concepts of NMR and MRI as his lasting legacy.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Pelvic external fixation device External fixation is a surgical technique in which the proximal end of a pin or bolt is screwed into bone while the other end is connected to a stabilizing structure outside the body. The usual clinical indication for external fixation devices is to stabilize complex, open, or infected fractures, especially those of the pelvis or long bones. The distal ends of each pin are attached by clamp connectors to a framework of rods that can be adjusted as needed to improve alignment. Several potential risks are associated with external fixation devices in the MR environment: Magnetic displacement or rotation of the frame if certain components are ferromagnetic. RF- or gradient-induced heating of the device with resulting thermal burns along pin tracts or where the frame is in contact with the skin. Because the device is predominantly outside the body where the E-field is strongest, conductive currents may be induced in the rods. Nearly two dozen companies worldwide manufacture external fixation hardware, the largest being DePuy Synthes, Zimmer Biomet, Stryker, Smith & Nephew, and Orthofix, Most offer systems that are MR Conditional up to 3.0T. The screws and connectors MR-compatible devices are typically composed of titanium- or cobalt-based alloys (Elgiloy, MP35N), while the rods must be made of a non-conducting material (fiberglass, carbon fiber reinforced epoxy). The conditions vary widely among the manufacturers, including limitations on specific device configurations and distance of the frame from magnet isocenter, in addition to the usual field strength and SAR considerations. Care must be taken in evaluating external fixation devices, as occasionally ferromagnetic parts from one system can be mixed with non-ferromagnetic parts from another. For example, the MRI- and non-MRI-compatible components of the Stryker's Hoffman II fixation system are structurally interchangeable and can be distinguished only by color and labeling. It is always a good idea to test the frame with a hand-held magnet prior to entry into the MR suite. While it is OK for the pins to be ferromagnetic (since they are firmly affixed to bone) the remainder of the external structure should not be. Even with fully MR-compatible external fixation arrays, an occasional patient may experience tingling or tugging during scanning, necessitating early termination of the scan. In some instances this may be due to vibrations in the frame due to gradient-switching-induced eddy currents. While harmless, these vibrations may be misinterpreted by the patient as heating. The phenomenon is more likely to occur when the fixation device is located far from magnet isocenter.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/external-fixators.html"}

To the right is a pulse timing diagram of a very simple gradient echo sequence, where a GRE is generated by applying a frequency-encoding gradient using two lobes of opposite polarity. The (first) dephase lobe causes spins to fall out of phase as a function of their position within the gradient. The (second) readout lobe brings these spins back into phase to create the echo. Echo with normal BW By convention, the height of each gradient lobe on this diagram is proportional to the strength of the gradient; its width reflects how long the gradient is applied. When a gradient is turned on spins at different locations will temporarily precess at different frequencies based on their position along the gradient. The area under a lobe (gradient strength x time) is proportional to the phase shift experienced by a given spin. (If you don't remember why this is so, you may need to review some basic concepts about phase and frequency from a prior Q&A ). The peak of the echo occurs during readout when the phase dispersal due to the dephase lobe is nullified. This happens when the area under the readout gradient matches the area under the dephase lobe. By reducing the height of the readout gradient but increasing its width, the shape of the echo will be changed so that will spread out and evolve over a longer period of time. This allows more time to digitally sample the MR signal. Echo with narrow BW / extended sampling time As discussed in the prior Q&A , the bandwidth (BW) of a digitized signal is inversely proportional the the dwell time ( t d ) , the interval between successive digital measurements. The dwell time, in turn, is defined as the total sampling time ( t s ) divided by the number of complex samples digitized ( n s ) . Combined into a single equation: This demonstrates the important relation that bandwidth is inversely proportional to sampling time . A synonym for \"narrow bandwidth\" is therefore \"extended sampling time\". For clinical MRI the term \"narrow bandwidth\" typically means a setting in the range of 5-20 kHz. Since the distribution of noise is fairly evenly distributed across the entire frequency spectrum, limiting BW reduces the amount of noise mixed in with the signal. Thus, decreasing BW increases the signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) within the image. This is particularly advantageous for long echo time ( TE ) images and for other situations where the MR signal may be weak. In spite of this SNR advantage, low bandwidth techniques with their longer sampling times should be used infrequently and with caution. First, longer sampling provides a longer window for unwanted spurious echoes to be detected. These may be manifest as rippling or zipper-like artifacts in the center of the image. The longer sampling window also gives more time for patient motion and flow artifacts to be generated. Secondly, chemical shift artifacts are accentuated using a narrow BW technique because a smaller band of frequencies spans each pixel. Similarly, magnetic field inhomogeneities and artifacts from ferromagnetic objects are accentuated. This may result in greater geometric distortion and greater slice-to-slice differences in size. Finally, more time spent collecting each echo limits the minimum TR , minimum TE, and maximum number of slices available for a given pulse sequence. Variable bandwidth , also known as optimal bandwidth or matched bandwidth , is a practical compromise that can be performed on multi-echo studies. Here, regular or high BWs are used for early echoes, while smaller BWs are used for later echoes where the signal is weaker. This option is available on all major brands of scanners under slightly different names: from GE and Hitachi as \"Variable Bandwidth (VB)\", Siemens as \"Optimized Bandwidth\", Philips as \"Optimized Water/Fat Shift\", and Canon as \"Matched Bandwidth\".", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/narrow-bandwidth.html"}

The MR scanning sequence begins by screening the patient for metallic foreign bodies and devices such as pacemakers that may represent a contraindication to imaging. The patient's important health conditions, including allergies, are also reviewed. Informed consent is obtained for the procedure including the administration of gadolinium, if ordered. The technologist fully explains what the scanning procedure entails and answers questions. Thus prepared for the study, the patient is led into the scanner room for the scan itself. 2. Patient positioning . The patient is placed on the table, usually in the supine position. Receiver imaging coils are arranged around the body part of interest (head, chest, knee, etc.) If EKG or respiratory gating is required, then these devices are attached at this time. A key anatomic structure such as the bridge of the nose or umbilicus is identified as a landmark using laser guidance, and this is correlated with table position by pressing a button on the gantry. Main protocol page for a GE MRI scanner. (Click to enlarge) 3. Protocol selection . Most MR sites have developed an extensive list of imaging protocols for various diseases and clinical scenarios. Each protocol typically contains a half dozen or so pulse sequences oriented in different planes and with different parameter weightings. For example, for cranial imaging there might be protocols called \"Routine Adult Brain\", \"Routine Infant Brain\", \"Epilepsy Brain\", \"MR Angiogram Circle of Willis\", and a dozen others. The technologist simply calls up the desired protocol from the library to begin scanning. Alternatively, generic sequences are also present in the scanner library that can be modified for specialized views or techniques. 4. Localizer scans . A set of three-plane, low-resolution, large field-of view localizers are first obtained, equivalent to \"scout views\" in CT. These localizer images will be used for plotting slices in step 6. 5. Calibration scans for parallel imaging . If parallel imaging is to be performed, a coil sensitivity calibration scan may also be required. This blurry image is not used for diagnosis but is often displayed as a separate series. Localizer with slices plotted 6. Position slices and saturation bands . At this point the exact positions and angulation of slices will be graphically specified.

If saturation bands are required, these are also graphically positioned at this time. Once the slices and bands have been specified and parameters tweaked, the \"Scan\" button is pushed and the image acquisition process finally begins. 7. Automatic prescan . Scanning begins, but not immediately. The scanner first goes through a brief (10-20 sec) calibration procedure known as prescan . Prescan consists of 6 steps: quick higher-order shimming, coil tuning/matching, center frequency calibration, transmitter gain adjustment, receiver gain adjustment, and dummy cycle stimulation. Although a fully automated process, manual adjustments are also sometimes needed. These prescan steps are described more completely in subsequent Q&A's. 8. Acquire images . Finally, the desired pulse sequence is run and the images are produced. Hooray! Steps 6 through 8 are then repeated until all sequences in the protocol have been run. 9. Post-processing . Additional post-processing is required for a number of advanced sequences, including MR angiography, vascular and CSF flow studies, cardiac imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, functional MRI, and spectroscopy. This can be done on the main scanner console or on a separate workstation. 10. Data archiving . The images and processed data are stored on a PACS or other archival system.

Superconductive scanners all have a refrigeration system including a pump for liquid helium. This pump creates a relatively quiet, low-frequency, rhythmic \"thump-thump\" background noise that is present whether or not a scan is being performed. Much louder noises occur during scanning from vibrations of gradient coils as rapidly switched electrical currents pass through them. These vibrations may be radiated into the air as sound waves or transmitted by physical linages to other parts of the building. Each pulse sequence produces a characteristic noise pattern based on its gradient waveforms. Echo-planar sequences are typically the loudest, producing sound pressures in the range of 110-120 dB. This \"jackhammer\" level of noise may create patient discomfort, and anxiety, and even temporary hearing loss. Providing patients with ear plugs or headphones during scanning is therefore mandatory. Mechanical methods to reduce noise transmission include: use of acoustic wall, floor and ceiling tiles; true double wall construction with separate unconnected studs; placing absorptive material (fiberglass) between the studs; sealing wall junctions with acoustic caulking; offsetting the drywall seams; lining air ducts with absorbent material and installing intermittent baffles; assuring doors and windows are tight-fitting; sealing areas around penetration panels and pipes; and installing a vibration pad between the magnet and the floor. Canon has introduced a gradient design (called Pianissimo  ) in which the gradients are enclosed in a vacuum chamber and mounted on a support that separates the gradient coil from the magnet structure. Other vendors have made manufacturing changes such as more tightly binding the gradient coil layers with resin to reduce vibrations. Recently the major MR vendors have released low-noise imaging software package known as SilentScan (GE), QuietX (Siemens), and ComforTone (Philips). These low-noise sequences have similar structures to conventional ones, but utilize \"gentler\" gradient waveforms with more gradual ramp-up and ramp-down times. These methods reduce scanner noise to within 10 dB of background but carry an approximately 10% signal-to-noise penalty as a result of shorter available windows for data sampling. To achieve nearly complete gradient silence, a completely different type of pulse sequence is required. The GE and Siemens strategies are similar, employing 3D ultrashort (\"zero\") TE methods. Known as Silenz and PETRA , these techniques are described more completely in the Advanced Techniques: Ultrashort TE section.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/whats-that-noise.html"}

Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) imaging measures T1 changes in tissues over time after bolus administration of gadolinium. It differs from Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) imaging in that the latter measures T2 and T2* changes. Immediately after injection, gadolinium contrast agents reside in plasma and are circulated to organs in proportion to blood flow. The relatively small molecular size of these agents (5001000 Da) allows them to pass through the vascular endothelium via passive diffusion into the extracellular space of most tissues. The only exceptions are the brain and spinal cord, where specialized tight endothelial junctions create a blood-brain barrier (BBB) that precludes this process. If the BBB is disrupted by tumor, infection, or other disease, however, gadolinium will then accumulate, producing T1-shortening and contrast enhancement. Breakdown of BBB in a glioma Observing and quantifying the time course of this contrast enhancement is the major goal of DCE imaging. As a general principle, the degree of contrast enhancement depends on regional blood flow ( F ), the size and number of blood vessels quantified by their surface area per unit mass of tissue ( S ), and their leakiness or permeabilit y (P) . Although it may not be possible to separate F , P , and S components individually, by mathematical modeling we can measure their combined effect reflected in the so-called transfer constant (K trans ) . K trans is an index characterizing the diffusive influx of gadolinium contrast across the vascular endothelium. DCE-derived indices like K trans have become increasingly important in the evaluation of tumor response to therapy, especially for non-cytotoxic agents that target tumor vascularity. K trans has also been used to assess inflammatory processes in the the lung, joints, and other organs. In addition to K trans , additional tissue specific parameters may be estimated by DCE including: the volume fraction of the extravascular extracellular space ( v e ) in tissue, the volume fraction of plasma in tissue ( v p ), and the rate constant for efflux of gadolinium contrast back into plasma from the tissue extracellular space ( k ep ). The meaning, significance, and calculation of these various DCE parameters will be elucidated in the next several Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-dce.html"}

Complete gradient system showing coils mounted along the inner bore of the scanner driven by a powerful current amplifiers and cooled by water chillers in the adjacent MR equipment room. (Radiofrequency (RF) coils, located just inside the gradient coils, are also pictured. See analogic.com for more information.) Gradients are loops of wire or thin conductive sheets on a cylindrical shell lying just inside the bore of an MR scanner. When current is passed through these coils a secondary magnetic field is created. This gradient field slightly distorts the main magnetic field in a predictable pattern, causing the resonance frequency of protons to vary in as a function of position. The primary function of gradients, therefore, is to allow spatial encoding of the MR signal. Gradients also are critical for a wide range of \"physiologic\" techniques, such as MR angiography, diffusion, and perfusion imaging. Historically, gradients coils were were composed of individual wires wrapped onto cylindrical formers made of fiberglass and coated with epoxy resin. Many laboratory instruments and very-high-field human scanners still use this method. Today, however, most widely manufactured superconducting scanners utilize distributed windings in a \"fingerprint\" pattern consisting of multiple thin metallic strips or large copper sheets etched into complex patterns and applied to the cylinder. Gradient coils with discrete wire windings in a 7T scanner (from Human Connectisome Project) Gradient coil with thin metallic strips being applied in a fingerprint pattern to a former (courtesy Siemens) Gradient coil with distributed windings etched into copper conducting sheets (courtesy GEMS) Gradient cabinet containing 3 independent power amplifiers for x-, y-, and z-gradients. Three sets of gradient coils are used in nearly all MR systems: the x- , y-, and z-gradients. Each coil set is driven by an independent power amplifier and creates a gradient field whose z -component varies linearly along the x -, y -, and z -directions, respectively. The design of the z-gradients is usually based on circular (Maxwell) coils, while the transverse (x- and y-) gradients typically have a saddle (Golay) coil configuration. The physical principles underlying these designs will be considered in subsequent questions. Gradient coils for the 3 cardinal directions: x, y, and z Applying a gradient causes a frequency variation of protons as a function of position along the direction of the gradient. This change in frequency can be used for spatial encoding. If the gradient is played out during slice selection and again during signal readout, a slice can be selected perpendicular to the gradient direction. For example, if the z -gradient is turned on in this fashion, a transverse slice is created in a supine patient. Oblique slices can be obtained by turning on two or more gradients simultaneously. A frequent misconception about gradient fields is that the x - and y -gradients somehow skew or shear the main ( B o ) field transversely. That is not the case as is shown in the diagram to the right. The x - and y -gradients provide augmentation in the z -direction to the B o field as a function of left-right or anterior-posterior location in the gantry.

A real image is much more complex than the six-pixel example, but the general principles remain the same. Several minor differences are immediately apparent, however. In MR imaging we typically use at least 256 divisions along the frequency-encode axis, and thus the first FT spectrum will have 256+ frequency \"bars\" rather than 3. The number of echo signals acquired equals the number of phase encode steps, which is usually 192 or 256 rather than 2. The phase shifts between the rows are not simple multiples of 180, but vary from echo to echo depending on the size of the phase-encoding step. Because each echo has been acquired using a different set of inter-row phase shifts, the spectral amplitudes (heights of the bars) for each echo cannot simply be added or subtracted to compute individual pixel values as before. In order to sort out where each signal in a frequency column has originated, a second FT must be performed. This 2DFT encoding and reconstruction process is illustrated below, where multiple phase-encode steps generate an array of different MR signals from a slice through a spherical phantom. The first Fourier transformation of each of these signals provides a crude frequency-projection of the object, modified by the phase shifts imparted by each step. Note that for low order phase-encodings, the MR signal is strong. The frequency projection approximates the general shape of the object but lacks edge definition. The higher order phase encode steps have smaller MR signals but provide more information about spatial detail, such as the location of edges. To construct the final image, a second Fourier transform is performed using data from this intermediate stage grouped into columns of the same frequency. Note that in our example, the data in each of these columns has the form of a decaying oscillation reminiscent of a sinc function. Indeed, this is the case, because the final projection of the object along each line in the phase encode direction is in the form of a rectangle. Graphic representation of how an image section is spatially encoded during 2DFT imaging. A set of MR signals is acquired using the same frequency-encoding gradient but different values of the phase-encoding gradient. Each of the MR signals is Fourier-transformed to provide a frequency spectrum of each phase-encoding step. Note that the high order PE steps provide edge detail. Each column of data from the stack of the 1st FT \"images\" is transformed again to determine the spatial projection of the slice within the image plane. Image processing interrupted after 1st FT of a spherical object Following the 2nd FFT the true image is reconstructed. To reinforce to you that this process is \"real\", I have imaged a spherical phantom in my scanner and stopped image processing after the first Fourier transform has been performed. Here we see that the raw signal data has been converted into a crude frequency projection of the object's cross section. Along the horizontal (frequency encoding) axis we see the edges of the object; we are unsure at this stage what it looks like in its vertical extent. By performing Fourier transformation along each vertically oriented frequency column, we can reconstruct the final image which is a homogenous in signal and round in cross-section.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/2dft-reconstruction.html"}

T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GRE) sequences have long been used to detect blood products and calcifications due to their sensitivity to local susceptibility effects. These sequences are characteristically operated in 2D multi-slice mode using relatively long TR's and low flip angles (both minimizing T1 effects) and relatively long TE's (to accentuate T2* dependence). Typical parameters for T2*-GRE brain imaging at 1.5T might be TR = 700, TE = 25, and  = 20. Post-traumatic brain injury showing many more axonal microhemorrhages (arrows) on SWI than on GRE Modern susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) methods are likewise based on GRE sequences, but incorporate numerous enhancements to heighten their sensitivity as well as phase mapping to distinguish paramagnetic (hemorrhage/iron) from diamagnetic (calcification) substances. Additionally, all experienced investigators have encountered numerous clinical cases where the number of lesions on SWI far exceed those on T2*-GRE. The most dramatic examples showing the superiority of SWI over GRE include traumatic brain injury and microvascular angiopathy. To be fair, SWI sequences do take more time to acquire than simple T2*-GRE's, and sometimes their image quality is not as good due to motion artifacts.

Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a rare, progressive, often fatal disease characterized by skin thickening, painful joint contractures, and fibrosis of multiple organs including the lungs, liver, muscles, and heart. Nearly all documented cases have occurred in patients with chronic severe renal insufficiency who have received gadolinium contrast. The association between gadolinium and NSF was first reported by Danish nephrologists in 2006. Between 2006 and 2010 several hundred cases were diagnosed worldwide. NSF usually develops clinically within days to months following gadolinium exposure, although rare cases have been reported years later. Nearly all patients have been in various degrees of renal failure and many were on dialysis. Only exceedingly rare cases have been reported in patients with eGFRs > 30 mL/min/1.73m. High and/or multiple doses of contrast are frequently reported, as are the use of linear contrast agents (ACR Group I). Other risk factors include liver diease and acidosis. The strong association with renal insufficiency most likely relates to the prolonged biological half-life due to prolonged excretion of gadolinium. However, other factors have been imputed, including metabolic acidosis; elevated iron and phosphate levels; erythropoietin therapy; vasculopathy; and infectious/inflammatory mediators. The pathogenesis of NSF is believed to begin with the displacement of the Gd ion from its chelate by another metallic cation (Fe +3 , Zn +2 , or Ca +2 ) through a so-called transmetalation reaction : (Metal ion) + Gd-Chelate  Metal-Chelate + Gd +3 The free Gd ion is then deposited in the skin and other soft tissues. There it is engulfed engulfed by CD163+ iron-recycling and other macrophages creating an inflammatory response and cytokine release. Circulating fibrocytes (immunologically unique CD-34 positive cells derived from bone marrow) deposit in tissue, transforming into spindle cells that proliferate and become the hallmark of the disease. Following recognition of this disorder and its association with gadolinium in patients with renal insufficiency, the worldwide radiology community responded immediately to put an end to this iatrogenic disease. Today, NSF has been nearly completely eliminated due to these measures. In more recent times, however, gadolinium-induced plaques have been reported in the extremities not meeting the full criteria for NSF. The story of NSF is sad one that we radiologists created. It should serve as a lesson that even drugs which appear to be extraordinarily safe may not be infinitely safe for all patients. Sometimes adverse effects may be subtle, disguised, or appear at long time intervals following administration. NSF is thus a call and reminder to be forever vigilant.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-nsf.html"}

There are always trade-offs, and here are four of the most significant: 1) Lower signal-to-noise . Although a number of complex factors determine image quality, signal-to-noise is approximately proportional to field strength. All other things being equal, therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio will be smaller in a lower-field scanner. Consequently, to maintain equivalent signal-to-noise, more signal averages and longer imaging times will be necessary in a lower-field scanner. 2) Lower homogeneity . The main magnetic fields of permanent and resistive scanners is significantly less uniform (homogeneous) than that of superconducting scanners. This impairs image quality especially over large fields-of-view and limits the ability to perform certain pulse sequences (such as chemical shift fat suppression, echo-planar imaging, and MR spectroscopy) 3) Impaired detection of calcifications and hemorrhage . Susceptibility artifacts are proportional to field strength, and although this may be an advantage for lower-field scanners for reduced metal artifacts, it may also be a disadvantage as well. In particular, lower-field units are inferior to high-field scanners in their ability to detect focal areas of calcification, iron accumulation, or hemorrhage in tissue. 4) Reduced detection of gadolinium enhancement . Gadolinium enhancement is less apparent at lower than higher fields, requiring relatively higher doses of gadolinium contrast to be administered for the same relative enhancement.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Skeletal traction is principally used for reducing deformity and stabilizing complex fractures or dislocations, often as a temporizing measure prior to open reduction and surgical internal fixation. A typical apparatus, shown right, illustrates the use of traction to to treat a femur fracture. A thin metal rod (e.g., Steinmann pin , Kirschner \"K\"-wire ) is first percutaneously screwed through the upper tibia, then connected with a bow to a cable and pulley system to which weights are attached. Traction apparatus for a femur fracture (Modified from Choudhry under CC BY) Although completely MRI-compatible skeletal traction systems are available, most facilities have legacy components including cast-iron weights and stainless steel bows that are MR Unsafe . Caution should even be directed concerning \"sandbag\"-type weights, that occasionally contain iron pellets instead of sand or lead. Evaluation of the entire traction system with a hand-held magnet prior to entry into the MRI scanner room is advised. Cervical Spine Traction and Halo Vests Unstable upper cervical spine fractures and dislocations are often initially treated with mechanical traction. Traction pins are inserted into the outer table of the skull by means of Gardner-Wells-type tongs (2 pins) or, more commonly, by an oval 4-pin halo device. Once satisfactory alignment has been obtained, the halo can be converted into a halo vest (which may be the definitive treatment for certain fractures in lieu of surgery). General MR safety issues similar to those discussed for other external fixation devices ( see related Q&A ) apply to halo vests, including magnetic displacement/torque and eddy-current induced vibrations. Many models are MR Unsafe . MR Conditional Halo Vest An additional safety concern is the possibility of scalp burns at the site of halo pins from induced currents. As such MR conditional halos and halo vests must have rings and supports that are not only made out of non-ferrous materials, but also non-conductive ones, such as fiberglass or carbon fiber composites. To further prevent burns, the scalp pins of at least one halo manufacturer (  ssur ) are ceramic-tipped.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/traction-and-halos.html"}

Water is present in tissues at concentrations 10,000 times higher than metabolites of interest (like NAA, Cho, Cr). An unprepared MR spectrum would thus be dominated by a giant water peak, while small organic molecules would be virtually undetectable above background noise. To visualize these interesting small organic molecules, the large water peak must be suppressed. Methods to accomplish this are described below, the most common being CHESS ( CHEmical Shift Selective saturation ) or one of its variants. CHESS was originally developed as a technique for fat suppression in conventional MR imaging, where it is commonly known by the generic name \"fat-sat\". By tuning the CHESS pulses to the resonant frequency of water instead of fat, water suppression may be obtained. A CHESS pulse selectively rotates water magnetization into the transverse plane where it is immediately dephased by application of a strong spoiler gradient . For MR spectroscopy a single CHESS pulse provides insufficient water suppression, so 3 CHESS pulses are used in the typical clinical implementation. To insure frequency selectivity, CHESS pulses are relatively long (20-30 ms). The optimal flip angle for each pulse depends on the interpulse spacing as well as local T1 and B 1 effects. MR vendors offer automated water suppression procedures that iteratively evaluate and optimize flip angles based on the residual water signal.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/water-suppression.html"}

Conversion of raw DSC imaging data into quantitative blood flow measurements takes place in three steps: Translation of tissue MR signal s(t) into gadolinium concentration c(t) ; Selection of an appropriate arterial input function a(t) ; and Mathematical modeling and computation. The first two steps have been described in prior Q&As. This section addresses mathematical methods to quantify blood flow knowing only c(t) and a(t) . The analysis comes from from linear systems theory and requires several important assumptions: Blood flow ( F ) and blood volume ( V ) remain constant during the measurement period. All injected tracer molecules eventually flow out of the system. In other words, there is no permanent trapping, pooling, or loss of tracer within the tissue. The system has a linear response to inputs and follows the principle of superposition. This means that the total output response from two independent inputs is the same as the sum of responses from those inputs considered separately. The reader will immediately recognize how easily this simple model may fail in practice. For example, a brain tumor accumulating gadolinium contrast through a leaky blood-brain-barrier would not meet assumption #2. Blood volume (V) is the first and easiest parameter to extract. Assuming no leakage or recirculation effects, V is proportional to the area under the tissue concentration curve c(t) during the first pass of contrast. Theoretically this relationship can be made quantitative by dividing by the gadolinium concentration a voxel containing only blood. Typically such a reference voxel is chosen to lie within a feeding artery, and the arterial input function curve, a(t) , is convenient to use. (A voxel from a large vein can also be chosen, a common practice in CT perfusion studies). In mathematical form Blood flow (F) is the next parameter to be calculated, but the process for doing so is somewhat \"convoluted\". (Please forgive the old physics pun). Understanding the method requires a brief introduction to linear systems theory. A linear system (e.g., the tissue capillary bed) can be analyzed by considering its response to a hypothetical infinitely high intensity, infinitely short duration impulse called the Dirac delta function (t) . For our system (t) could be viewed as the instantaneous injection of a bolus of contrast particles into the tissue through an arterial port at time t=0 . After injection, some of these particles will find relatively direct pathways to the venous port; others will choose more circuitous routes and take longer to traverse the capillary bed. This results in a dispersion of the injected contrast bolus within tissue and a range of particle transit times. The fraction of injected contrast particles remaining in the tissue at time t after such an impulse injection is known as the residue , described by the dimensionless function R(t) . Immediately after injection (before any particles have left the system) R(t) is at its maximum with value R(0) = 1. As particles flow out of the system, R(t) decreases, eventually reaching final value R(  ) = 0 when no contrast remains in the tissue. The width of the residue function reflects the distribution of particle transit times through a tissue. Tissues with rapid transit times have sharp, narrow residue curves, while tissues with prolonged transit times have wide ones. The area under the residue function reflects the average time a particle spends transitioning through the tissue vascular bed, an important physiological parameter known as the mean transit time (MTT) . In mathematical form Upper figures: a real-life arterial input function (AIF) with corresponding resultant tissue concentration curve c(t) Lower figures: modeling the tissue response by a set of Dirac delta functions In real life it is impossible to deliver an arterial bolus of contrast to tissue instantaneously. The arterial input function, a(t), is thus always dispersed in time as shown in the figure. This broad arterial input, however, can be represented as a set of Dirac delta functions at different time delays (  ), each producing an independent response. The mathematical operation of scaling and summing these individual impulse responses to generate the tissue contrast concentration curve c(t) is known as convolution . In mathematical notation where F is blood flow and the \"circle/x\" symbol is the convolution operator. The convolution process sums together (\"integrates\") the individual arterial inputs weighted (\"multiplied\") by the residue function at various time delays (  ) after injection. To account for the fact that gadolinium contrast distributes only in the extracellular space of blood vessels, some versions of this equation contain a constant factor (  / h ) preceding F , where  is the tissue density in g/mL and h is a fraction accounting for the difference in hematocrit between capillaries and larger vessels. In a DSC perfusion experiment we measure a(t) and c(t) directly, but do not know either the blood flow ( F ) nor the residue function, R(t) . Because there are more unknowns than knowns in this equation, a unique solution does not exist. Nevertheless, various mathematical techniques can extract reasonable estimates for these parameters, especially blood flow ( F ). Three general strategies for performing mathematical deconvolution exist. The most common method converts the equation into matrix form and perform iterative calculations with a procedure known as singular value decomposition (SVD) . A second approach, less widely used, is called \"parametric\", because it assumes a predetermined shape for the residue function such as a decaying exponential. Other deconvolution techniques involve Fourier transformation or stochastic estimation. The end result of all the deconvolution methods is a quantitative estimate for blood flow (F). Since blood volume (V) has already been calculated, the final step is to compute the mean transit time (MTT) on a voxel-by-voxel basis using the central volume theorem ( MTT = V/F) . It should be noted that significantly different results may be obtained depending on the choice of the AIF as well as which commercial software product for calculation is used. Even software claiming to use identical methods may give different results when applied to the same raw data. Caution is advised in relying too heavily on the absolute numbers obtained from such quantitative methods. The concept of (de)convolution is admittedly confusing for those without a strong mathematical background, but my colleague Josh Shimony makes it quite understandable in this vimeo video beginning at about minute 33:00.

Estimation of Tissue pH The chemical shifts of many P metabolites are responsive to local tissue pH. PCr is relatively immune to such changes, while Pi is highly sensitive. The chemical shift difference between PCr and Pi can therefore be used to estimate tissue pH. The relationship is relatively linear over normal physiological ranges where a chemical shift difference (  ) increase of 0.1 ppm corresponds to a pH increase of approximately 0.08 units. In tissues like liver and kidney where no PCr peak is detectable, a similar method using the shift between P i and the  -ATP peak may be used. Dynamic Metabolic Spectra Rapidly acquired P spectra can be obtained during sustained muscular contraction or exercise. As shown below, during muscular contraction PCr is depleted to maintain constant ATP levels while Pi accumulates. Acidosis (lowered pH) develops as manifest by decreasing chemical shift between the Pi and PCr peaks. Upon session of contraction, metabolites return to their baseline levels.

SENSE (SENSitivity Encoding) and ASSET (Array coil Spatial Sensitivity Encoding) are among the most widely used parallel imaging methods. These techniques are primarily performed in image space after reconstruction of data from the individual coils. (This contrasts with GRAPPA/ARC methods which operate primarily on k -space data before image reconstruction). Each major MR vendor offers some version of the SENSE technique under different trade names: Siemens ( mSENSE ), GE ( ASSET ), Philips ( SENSE ), Hitachi ( RAPID - \"Rapid Acquisition through Parallel Imaging Design\"), and Canon ( SPEEDER ). SENSE/ASSET involves 4 steps: 1. Generate coil sensitivity maps 2. Acquire partial k - space MR data 3. Reconstruct partial FOV images from each coil 4. Unfold/Combine partial FOV images by matrix inversion Calculating coil sensitivities are the initial and most important step in the SENSE process. Low-resolution images are acquired separately from each surface coil at full field-of-view. These surface coil images are normalized by dividing them by a low-resolution body coil image. Filtering, thresholding, and point estimation are then applied to the data to generate coil sensitivity maps (shown right). These maps quantify the relative weighting of signals from different points of origin within the reception area of each coil. The calculation of coils sensitivities may be obtained as a separate ~20 second acquisition before actual imaging begins (GE uses this method for ASSET). Alternatively, automated coil calibration may be integrated into the pulse sequence itself (Siemens' mSENSE). The latter method has the advantage of being less sensitive to motion that occurs between the time of calibration and the beginning of the scan proper. Once coil sensitivity maps have been calculated, the MR pulse sequence begins. For a PI acceleration factor of 2, alternate lines of k -space are skipped, resulting in a -FOV images obtained from each coil with aliasing (wrap-around). A matrix inversion process is used to unfold and combine the aliased images from each coil. How this inversion process works is not as complicated as it may at first appear, so please try to follow the simple 2-pixel example below: During the prescan calibration step the scanner has calculated point-by-point sensitivities for each surface coil, now stored in memory as a big array of numbers. For an MR signal arising from point A in the patient, the sensitivities of Coils 1 and 2 for detecting that signal will be denoted S 1A and S 2A respectively. Similarly, the coil sensitivities for any other point B are also known and will be denoted S 1B and S 2B . When the data from each coil are reconstructed into images, significant wrap-around (fold-over) artifact is present. This phenomenon, known as aliasing , has occurred because an insufficient number of frequency components have been sampled during the imaging process to uniquely distinguish all spatial locations. Each pixel (P) in the -FOV images has a signal that is the sum of contributions from two points (A and B) in the patient. Denoting these pixel values from Coils 1 and 2 by P 1 and P 2 , we can write P 1 = AS 1A + BS 1B P 2 = AS 2A + BS 2B Since the P i 's and S i 's are all known, the true signals (A and B) can be calculated by simple algebraic methods for solving 2 simultaneous equations with 2 unknowns. In the MR scanner a similar process is performed for all data points in the image using a matrix inversion technique, but the idea is the same. Hopefully this example will remove some of the mysteries surrounding the PI reconstruction process for SENSE.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/senseasset.html"}

In the prior Q&A we briefly described several machine learning techniques (including logistic regression, cluster analysis, and support vector machines) used to classify and subdivide large data sets. Here we explain several important methods to prepare raw data for analysis and to optimally fit it to a given model. Selecting a Model In many quantitative data processing scenarios a straightforward model may be relatively easy to select. As a simple example, one may wish to find a relationship between liver and spleen volumes on MRI. Or another  to classify whether a patient has Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, or some other dementia based upon the thickness of cortical gray matter. These types of problems could be amenable to modeling by regression or one of the other shallow learning techniques (support vector machine, cluster analysis, random forest) as described in a prior Q&A . In other situations, such as reducing motion artifacts in an MR image, the best model may not at all be obvious and a generalized deep learning approach (such as a convolutional neural network) is needed. Here the network may be allowed to find its own optimal solution by analyzing in training data that has been partially or fully labeled. Data Preparation The first recommended step is to normalize the data. This is typically done by zero-centering it in each direction, then normalizing it to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 along each direction . Initializing Model Parameters Prior to training the network, initialization of network parameters such as weights and biases for each neuron must be selected. One popular choice (a version of the Xavier initialization ) is to set starting parameters with values drawn randomly from a Gaussian distribution of mean = 0 and standard deviation =  (2/n) , where n = the number of inputs + outputs for each neuron. A even better method may be the He initialization (optimized for ReLU activations), where n = the number of inputs only. In truth, AI application developers seldom start with such highly randomized initialization parameters. Instead, they often employ a transfer learning approach, copying weights and biases from other tested networks as a starting point. This approach can significantly reduce training time for the new network being designed. Training After selecting a model and preparing the raw data, training of the network must take place. For image-based applications, a supervised learning technique is most commonly used. The data scientists will likely have at their disposal a reasonably large number of cases (usually in the thousands or higher) that contain images each with an independently verified label serving as \"ground truth\". For example, the cases might all be MR images of brain tumors together with a binary label (e.g., benign or malignant). Armed with this labeled data set, the investigators will save out a relatively small proportion (10-15%) of the whole to be used as a validation set after the network has been fully trained. The other labeled samples (85-90%) will form the training set . For computational efficiency, this training data is usually divided into batches (typically of size 32, 64, 128, or another factor of 2). After each training batch is passed through the network, the predicted output from the network is compared to the table of ground truths and a loss function (error score) is calculated. Weighting factors and parameters of the network are then modified in an iterative fashion to minimize the loss function. Usually iterations of several batches are needed so that all training examples have had a chance to have been fed through the network. At this point an epoch is said to have been completed. To fully train the network many epochs are needed, often in the hundreds or thousands, which can take hours or days even on fast computers. The Loss Function The Loss Function , also sometimes known as the Cost or Error Function , is a measure of the level of error in a network's output when using a certain set of internal parameters (such as weights and biases). Two loss functions are commonly used: Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss . This is average of the squared differences between the expected and predicted values, given by the formula MSE Loss functions are typically used when the outcome is numeric, such as a distance measurement or volume. This is the metric by which linear regression is optimized. Cross-Entropy (CE) Loss . Also known as Logistic Loss or Log Loss , this method penalizes errors using a non-linear function (logarithm). When the difference between expected and predicted values is small, the penalty is small; but when the difference is large, the penalty can be enormous. The CE Loss formula for a binary classification system is written as Overfitting and Underfitting What is the optimal number of parameters to optimally fit a set of data? As all data sets vary, there is no general answer to this question, but the problems with overfitting and underfitting can be appreciated in the diagrams below: In underfitting , the model has an insufficient number of parameters to fully learn the data. In overfitting the model is too complex and contains too many parameters. The computational burden is excessive and even though it fits the sample data with high precision, the model is highly optimized for the particular training data and will not generalize well to other data sets. Regularization One possible solution to overfitting would be to collect more training data points. However, this is time-consuming and may not be practical if training data is hard to generate. Another option would be to reduce the number of model parameters, but this is a blunt instrument and it is often not clear at the onset how many variables will actually need to be used. Rather than directly manipulating the number of parameters, a more robust method is to restrict the values that the parameters can take, a process known as regularization . The most commonly used technique is known as L2 regularizatio n , which adds an additional term to the loss function of the form (w ) where  is a user-defined constant known as the regularization strength and w is the sum of squared values of the calculated weights at each step of training. A second and very useful regularization method applicable to most multilayer networks is known as dropout . As the name implies, various nodes and their outputs are randomly ignored or temporarily dropped out of the model during training. Typical dropout rates are about 20% of input nodes and 20-50% of intermediate nodes. (Output nodes do not participate). Dropout has several direct and indirect effects on the network: 1) it means that the structure of the network will randomly change from time to time, forcing nodes to be more independent; 2) it introduces noise, making the weight calculations less dependent on a particular configuration of training data, thus reducing overfitting; and 3) it may break apart co-dependent nodes that adapt to fix mistakes committed by other nodes in prior layers, thus making the model more robust. Batch Normalization Batch normalization is a procedure applied to rescale outputs of intermediate layer neurons during the course of training so that their values are Gaussian with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 . Recall that one of the first steps in data preparation was to normalize the input data to the network so that each first layer neuron could expect to receive a consistent range of information. But deeper layers in the network have no such guarantee what their inputs may be (sometimes extremely large or extremely small). They become highly dependent on earlier nodes. By renormalizing inputs to nodes at intermediate layers, training speeds can be markedly improved. Because it restricts large swings in intermediate data, batch normalization is also provides a modest degree of regularization.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/data-prep-and-fitting.html"}

Susceptibility is a measure of the extent to which a substance becomes magnetized when it is placed in an external magnetic field. A synonym for susceptibility is \"magnetizability\" . When matter interacts with the magnetic field, an internal magnetization or polarization (J) is created that either opposes or augments the external field. If the polarization opposes the applied field, the effective field within the object is reduced, the lines are dispersed, and the effect is known as diamagnetism . If the polarization is in the same direction as the external field, the magnetic lines are concentrated within the object, resulting in paramagnetism , superparamagnetism , or ferromagnetism , depending on the degree of augmentation. Magnetic susceptibility , is denoted by the Greek letter chi ( ) , is defined as the magnitude of the internal polarization ( J ) divided by the strength of the external field ( B o ):  = J / B o Since it is the ratio of two magnetic fields, susceptibility is a dimensionless number. Diamagnetic substances have negative susceptibilities ( < 0); paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, and ferromagnetic substances have positive susceptibilities ( > 0). Nearly all biological tissues are weakly diamagnetic. However, some tissues contain focal accumulations of metals such as iron, gadolinium, copper, or manganese that concentrate the magnetic field and are therefore paramagnetic . A few tissues also contain chunky iron-based protein conglomerates (ferritin and hemosiderin) that are superparmagnetic . Other than trace amounts of magnetite that do not contribute to bulk susceptibility, there are no endogenous ferromagnetic substances in the human body. However, many extrinsic metallic foreign bodies and surgical implants are ferromagnetic , and these are commonly encountered in MR imaging. A summary of these different types of magnetic susceptibility are outlined in the table below, and explained in more detail in several follow-up questions.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-susceptibility.html"}

For most solid organs H 2 O is the only resonance observed. In adipose tissue, bone marrow, and to a lesser degree skeletal muscle, a significant contribution comes from lipid hydrogens, predominantly those residing in aliphatic (CH 2 ) chains of triglycerides. Smaller contributions come from the triglyceride methyl, carboxyl, and vinyl hydrogens. Some free fatty acids, liquid forms of cholesterol, and other oils make minor contributions to the MR signal. Phospholipids and sphingolipids, present in cell membranes and myelin respectively, have exceedingly short T2 values and their MR signal is not directly recorded on routine MR images. These lipid-containing macromolecules do indirectly affect the signal from water protons, described in a separate Q&A . Triglycerides are esters of glycerol and three fatty acids. The fatty acid chains are typically 16-20 carbon atoms in length and are mostly saturated ((CH 2 ) n ). These long chains have complex thermally-induced flexions and rotations, some of which occur near the Larmor frequency.

The initial convolutional and pooling layers of a CNN progressively reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the input and intermediate feature maps , a process known as encoding or downsampling . This produces a compressed representation of the input image that can be efficiently processed, allowing the network to extract key structural features and relationships within the input. For many image processing applications (such as segmentation, co-registration, artifact removal, and image enhancement) it may be desirable to reverse the process, gradually restoring the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while reducing the number of channels or features. This process is known as upsampling (also called decoding , unpooling, or upscaling ). Sequential downsampling and upsampling is the basis of encoder-decoder networks , one of the more commonly used image-processing AI architectures. Because of their shape, such configurations are also called U-networks . Encoder-decoder network, consisting of a convolution/pooling portion that reduces image dimensions (downsampling) followed by an upsampling portion which returns image dimensions to its original size (here with a tumor segmentation overlay). Several methods exist for the upsampling portion of th Interpolation Methods for Upsampling Nearest Neighbor : This method involves duplicating the existing pixels or samples to create new ones. It is the simplest and fastest method but may result in a blocky or pixelated appearance. Bed of NailsTechnique : Unlike Nearest Neighbor, the Bed-of-Nails only inputs one of the input elements in each region, setting the rest to zero. Max Unpooling : This is similar to the Bed-of-Nails but places elements in the larger matrix at locations from where they originally occurred. (This requires memory of their original locations). Bilinear Interpolation : This method computes the value of new pixels by taking a weighted average of the nearest four pixels. It results in a smoother image than nearest neighbor interpolation but may introduce artifacts such as blurring and aliasing. Bicubic Interpolation : This method uses a more complex interpolation algorithm that takes into account 16 neighboring pixels to compute the value of new pixels. It results in a higher-quality image than bilinear interpolation but requires more computational resources. Lanczos Interpolation : This method uses a weighted average of a larger number of neighboring pixels to compute the value of new pixels. It produces sharp and detailed images but requires a larger kernel size and more computational resources. Three types of unpooling/upscaling to increase size of feature maps from 2x2 to 4x4. Nearest Neighbor Unpooling replicates each element of the 2x2 input into 4 identical adjacent locations in the 4x4 matrix. The Bed of Nails method only replicates one of the input elements in corresponding 2x2 regions, setting the rest to zero. Max Unpooling is similar to the Bed of Nails, but places elements in the larger matrix at locations from where they originally occurred. Transposed Convolution Transposed convolution , also called (backward) strided convolution, is one of the more common and sophisticated techniques for upsampling or enlarging feature maps. It involves applying a learned convolutional filter to the reduced size feature maps in a way that reverses the effects of the original convolution operation. This is a learnable method that can be optimized during training and is effective for generating high-quality images of larger size. In \"regular\" convolution, a small kernel or filter is slid across the input signal or feature map, producing a set of output features or channels. The output feature map is typically smaller than the input, due to the kernel size and stride. In transposed convolution, the process is reversed. Instead of applying a kernel to a local region of the input, a kernel is applied to each location of the output feature map, with a stride that determines the distance between successive kernel positions. Each kernel output is then added to the corresponding location in the output feature map. The transposed convolution broadcasts input elements via the kernel, thereby producing an output that is larger than the input . A simple example is shown below. Transposed Convolution of 2x2 input with a 2x2 kernel to produce a 3x3 output. At each step, a single element (e.g., red) of the input matrix multiplies all 4 kernel elements, with the result placed in an intermediate 3x3 matrix at a location corresponding to position of the red input element. The process is repeated for the three other input elements. The four intermediate matrices are added together to create the final 3x3 output.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/upsampling.html"}

Definition of B The simplified definition of tesla describes only the magnitude ( B ) of the field at a given point. If the field is perfectly uniform, B is the same at all points within the field. In general, however, the structure of the magnetic field is more complex, and B may have different values and directions of action at different points in space. A magnetic field is therefore formally defined to be an array of vectors (denoted by the boldfaced letter B ) whose magnitude B and direction at each point in space define how the field will act on a charge moving at that location. Consider a hypothetical wire stretched across the bore of an MR scanner whose magnetic field B is shown in the picture. When a current is passed along this wire, a magnetically generated (Lorentz) force deflects the wire upward. This force ( F ) is proportional to the current ( i ) , the length of the wire ( l ) , and the strength of the magnetic field ( B ) and is given by F = ( i l ) B The dimensional units for B are therefore newtons per ampere-meter, or te sla (T) .

A single study may be performed in the resting state only, but often both stress and resting perfusion series are acquired back-to-back. Pharmacologic \"stress\" is created by intravenous infusion of a vasodilator (adenosine/regadenoson) or positive inotrope (dobutamine). Delayed post-enhancement images are also commonly obtained to assess the extent of damaged myocardium. Cine perfusion study. Contrast passes through RV, then LV, and finally into the myocardium. Single frame from cine study showing hypoperfusion (dark area, arrows) in the lateral wall Stress perfusion MRI is typically performed in patients with known or suspected coronary atherosclerosis to identify areas of inducible ischemia, to predict cardiac prognosis, to stratify risk for non-cardiac surgery, or to assess myocardial viability. Contraindications for a stress study include recent (<3 days old) myocardial infarction, unstable angina, uncontrolled arrhythmias, aortic dissection or aneurysm, active myocarditis/pericarditis, severe hypertension (>225/120), severe aortic stenosis, and allergies to gadolinium or stressor agents. In healthy persons the resistance of the coronary vascular bed is determined not by the larger (named) epicardial arteries, but by small (100250 m) intramural arterioles. These smaller vessels autoregulate myocardial flow by dilating in response to increased oxygen demand, local metabolites, and changes in blood pressure. The epicardial coronary arteries become flow-limiting only when narrowed by disease (atherosclerosis). The percent anatomic stenosis of a coronary artery is only a crude/imperfect predictor of clinical significance and response to therapy. For example, a 60% stenosis may not be symptomatic at rest, but become flow-limiting when the distal tree is maximally dilated. Resistance of coronary bed is determined by small intramural arterioles until large epicardial arteries become narrowed by atherosclerosis. The dynamic nature of cardiac ischemia is reflected in the concept of coronary flow reserve (CFR) , first proposed by Gould in 1974. CFR is a measure of the degree to which the coronary circulation is able to increase myocardial blood flow when the perfusion bed is maximally dilated. Normal values of CFR vary by age and sex but are typically in the range of 3-4; CFR values less than 2 are generally pathologic and associated with ischemia/infarction. Contrast-enhanced MRI performed at rest and under pharmacologic stress does not measure CFR directly, but a closely related quantity, myocardial flow reserve (MFR) .

In other words, if the gradient field at distance D equals S , the gradient contribution at distance 2D should equal 2S . Like magnetic field homogeneity, gradient linearity falls off significantly the farther one gets from isocenter. No uniformly agreed upon definition for gradient linearity is used by all manufacturers. One of the oldest and most popular methods is called the differential linearity error , which gives a maximum percent gradient error over a given spherical volume. For example, a gradient might be described to have a linearity error of less than 2% within 50 cm of isocenter. This method mirrors the definition of magnetic field homogeneity as % field change over a defined spherical volume (DSV).

For example, a subject might be shown pictures of a dog while fMRI determines which voxels are most strongly activated (e.g., voxels 15/19/47). fMRI mind reading inverts this relationship requiring a reverse inference to be made. In other words, if fMRI shows activation of voxels 15/19/47 can we conclude the subject is seeing a dog? Several groups have tackled such problems using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and artificial intelligence methods with machine learning . Jack Gallant's team from the University of California at Berkley have been perhaps the most successful allowing visual decoding complex scenes and even creation of a brain \"dictionary\". Several commercial enterprises have jumped on the potential of fMRI for mind reading, including its use for \"neuro-marketing\" (e.g., determining brand preferences or response to commercials) and even lie detection (based on work by Harvard's Joshua Greene that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is more active in subjects contemplating lying). As discussed in the videos below by psychologist Tor Wager from the University of Colorado at Boulder, reverse inference experiments are tricky to do well and are prone to misinterpretation. Thus I believe that current commercial applications of fMRI are premature and their claims should be viewed with great skepticism. If performed and properly analyzed, however, fMRI can read your mind to a limited (but surprising) extent, with many exciting developments expected for the future.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mind-readinglie-detector.html"}

Why do these occur and what can be done to correct them? Take a look at the images below from two fMRI studies recently performed at our institution using standard pre-processing and GLM analysis. See anything wrong? How about those red blobs of \"activation\" that aren't within the brain? And if the images hadn't been cropped using an oval mask, many more extraneous blobs would have also been noted in \"outer space\" surrounding the head. We would have hoped such false positive activations would have been minimized by the rigorous statistical methods employed, but they were not. Most of the blobs in the left image are due to eye motion, partial volume effects, and physiological pulsations that have not been adequately compensated/corrected. Strategies for reducing physiological noise have been described in a prior Q&A and include data scrubbing, motion correction, temporal filtering, and incorporation of measured heart and respiratory patterns as covariates in the statistical model. Motion-related false positive activation. Note prominent signal in the orbits due to correlated eye motion during a task. Green arrows show physiologic artifacts due to vascular and CSF pulsations. Scattered foci of false positive activation in nasopharyngeal air, the occipital bone and neck muscles (arrows) are likely manifestations of random noise and inadequate statistics.

{"id": "13300145-e34a-4f39-84f7-b5265572ed8d", "contents": "GRE vs SE How does a gradient echo differ from a spin echo? A spin echo (SE) is produced by pairs of radiofrequency (RF) pulses, whereas a gradient echo (GRE) is produced by a single RF pulse in conjunction with a gradient reversal. The formation of a GRE is illustrated schematically. Following the RF pulse, the first negative-going lobe of the gradient causes a phase dispersion of the precessing spins. When this gradient is reversed, the spins refocus and form a gradient (recalled) echo. Second step in GRE formation. A rephasing gradient is applied (opposite in polarity to the dephasing gradient). This reverses the phase shifts induced by the dephasing gradient and resurrects the FID as GRE. Note that T2* decay continues unabated. Strong inflow enhancement and the ability to use short TE values make GRE sequences a standard method in MR angiography. Although GRE sequences suffer from inhomogeneity artifacts more than SE sequences, this can be put to an advantage. Here a GRE sequence is used to detect an area of remote hemorrhage because of its sensitivity to T2* effects. GRE imaging differs from SE imaging in several respects. First, because only one RF-pulse is applied, the echo can be recorded much more quickly in a GRE sequence. As a result, echo time ( TE ) is generally shorter for GRE sequences than for SE sequences. When GRE sequences are used with low-flip-angle excitations, short values of repetition time ( TR ) may also be used. The combination of short TR and short TE values allows for very rapid signal acquisition. For this reason GRE sequences form the basis for most rapid imaging and MR angiographic techniques. A second important feature of GRE imaging is that the gradient reversal refocuses only those spins that have been dephased by action of the gradient itself . Specifically, phase shifts resulting from magnetic field inhomogeneities, static tissue susceptibility gradients, or chemical shifts are not cancelled at the center of the GRE as they are in SE sequences. Image contrast is therefore dictated not by true T2-relaxation, but by these other factors which constitute T2*. GRE sequences are therefore more frequently troubled by susceptibility and chemical shift artifacts and do not function well on scanners whose magnetic fields lack homogeneity.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gre-vs-se.html"}

A nested hierarchy: AI >> ML >> DL No. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, all ML is AI, but not all AI is ML. What makes ML unique is that that machine learning systems can actually reprogram themselves. They employ self-modifiable algorithms that improve automatically over time through training and the use of data. They can carry out tasks without being explicitly programmed to do so. In brief, they actually learn from experience! Today the most important type of ML relevant to MRI is known as deep learning (DL), the subject of its own Q&A . But how do machines learn? More details will be presented in later Q&A's, but machine learning typically takes place using one of five methods: Supervised learning is the most widely used form of ML for radiological applications today. In this method, the computer system is provided with data sets (commonly images) that bear a known label (e.g., benign or malignant) established by an external authority (e.g., a panel of experts). These labels serve as a gold standard or ground truth by which the successful performance of the network will be assessed. Most of the labeled data sets will be used for training; a small number will be retained for final validation. During training, the algorithm attempts to classify the inputs, and its accuracy is compared to the table of ground truths. A loss function (or error score) is calculated. Weighting factors and parameters of the network are then modified in an iterative fashion to minimize the loss. After the algorithm has been optimized, its performance on a validation set of different cases with known labels is evaluated. The process is considerably more complicated than the paragraph above reveals, and these steps will be further elucidated in several subsequent Q&A's. In unsupervised learning the computer system is given a training set of data (e.g. tumor images) but without labels. It must then separate those images into groups based on extracted features (e.g., distribution of T2 values, size, edge characteristics). Popular techniques include self-organizing maps, k-means clustering, nearest-neighbor mapping, and singular value decomposition. Currently the most common use of unsupervised learning in medical imaging is to discover hidden structures within the training data. In semi-supervised learning only a small portion of the training set is labeled. The computer system then uses the unlabeled data to try to improve the classification of these data in a manner similar to unsupervised learning. Semi-supervised learning is often employed when a complete training set of fully labeled data is too expensive or difficult to acquire. Reinforcement learning is often used for natural language processing, robotics, and navigation applications. By trial and error the algorithm discovers which actions yield the greatest rewards (successful outcomes) over the shortest period of time. The popular Chat-GPT was optimized for dialogue by using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to guide the model toward human-like behavior. In transfer learning a model trained on one task is re-purposed and applied to a second related task. For example, a network previously optimized to identify human faces might be used as the first step to jumpstart an algorithm learning to segment a brain MRI.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/machine-learning-ml.html"}

Across the world a large number of regulatory bodies claim some jurisdiction over the production, sale, and safe use of MRI-related devices. At least four major international organizations have promulgated standards for MR performance and safety that have been most widely accepted and strongly influenced policies at the local or national levels. International Organizations The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) provides detailed methods and standards for evaluating all types of electrical devices. Those relating specifically to MRI are designated MS 1 to MS 12 and include how to measure signal-to-noise (MS 1, 6, & 9), geometric distortion (MS 2 & 12), uniformity (MS 3), acoustic noise (MS 4), slice thickness (MS 5), Specific Absorption Rate (MS 8 & 10), and gradient-induced fields (MS 7 & 11). The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) also has interest in the safe operation of MRI equipment. Its most recently published standard (IEC 60601-2-33) covers a wide range of topics and incorporates some of the NEMA guidelines above. A strong emphasis is on patient safety, including electrical and mechanical. It sets limits for peripheral nerve stimulation, specific absorption rate, and temperature changes, widely used in Europe (but not the US). The three-level operating mode hierarchy (described in another Q&A) is first defined in this document. The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) is concerned with human exposure to electromagnetic radiation in all forms and frequencies, and has issued statements and guidelines concerning both static and radiofrequency fields both for patients and workers in the MRI environment. Their suggested restrictions for workers are somewhat more conservative than those of the IEC and have more influence in Europe. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM International) has developed standards for testing of medical devices and implants. These include methods for measuring magnetic displacement force (F2052), torque (F2213), RF-induced heating (F2182), and implant-related artifacts (F2219). The ASTM is also responsible (F2503) for defining the terms MR Safe, MR Unsafe, and MR Conditional, and developing the familiar icons associated with each. Additional international societies involved in promulgation of MRI guidelines and exposure of humans to electromagnetic fields include: the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) , American National Standards Institute (ANSI) , the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) . Regional and National Organizations In the United States the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has statutory authority to regulate the sale and use of MRI equipment. MRI scanners are considered Class II devices, meaning that they have the potential for human harm and require pre-market 501(k) clearance prior to marketing. The FDA has issued guidance documents with non-binding (but strongly suggested) criteria  including those related to hardware, software, performance, site planning, and safety  to attain this premarket approval. Once approved, however, the FDA does not have authority to inspect MRI facilities to insure the equipment is being used in a safe or prudent fashion. Such activities lie under the domain of various state government agencies. Other organizations such as the American College of Radiology (ACR) or The Joint Commission (TJC) provide quality and safety criteria to certify MRI centers for operation and potential reimbursement for services. The European Union (EU) has established several MRI-related directives and regulations that apply to its member states, including restrictions on exposure to magnetic fields and certification of devices. In Canada, approval of an MR system granted by Health Canada , with details of operation and certification left to individual provinces. Canadian Safety Code 6 sets limits on electromagnetic field exposures. The Canadian Association of Radiologists (CAR) plays a role similar to that of the ACR in the US, issuing practice guidelines for MRI. Australia and New Zealand have generally followed EU guidelines and together with their Royal College of Radiologists (RANZR) . In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issues safety, management and exposure guidelines, while the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) oversees workplace-related issues.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/who-regulates-mri.html"}

It should be noted that most commercial MR markers contain a dilute paramagnetic solution rather than fats or oils, which has some advantage in that they are still visible on fat-suppressed images.

These agents are reasonably palatable (well, maybe not reasonably), producing a bright intraluminal signal on T1-weighted images.

However, they are absorbed in the middle and distal small bowel so are not suitable for jejunal, colon, or pelvic imaging.

The next step in the normal degradation pathway of hemoglobin involves transformation of methemoglobin into a low-spin forms with a greenish-hue known as hemichromes . Hemichromes can also form directly from deoxyhemoglobin without going through a methemoglobin intermediary. Hemichromes are typically produced by the slow denaturation of methemoglobin. During this process, the H 2 O molecule at the sixth coordination site is replaced by an amino acid (typically His) from a distal part (E7) of the globin chain. This oxidation process is accompanied by the release of a superoxide (O 2 ) radical with conversion of iron to a low-spin Fe(III) state that has lost its paramagnetic properties. Hemichromes thus have weak diamagnetism and their MR signal characteristics are dominated by the background material (usually water or residual serum components) within a hematoma cavity. Heinz bodies in RBCs The superoxide radicals produced may damage cell walls leading to lysis of erythrocytes. During certain metabolic derangements and anemias, heimchromes may precipitate in red cells to form Heinz bodies . In addition to changes near the heme centers, oxidative denaturation and conformational distortions are occurring in other parts of the hemoglobin molecule. The most important of these include exposure and oxidation of previously \"buried\" cysteine sulfhydryl groups that disrupt contacts between the 1 and 2 globin chains. Ultimately dissociation of polypeptide chains occurs, first into  dimers and later into monomers. Finally, the heme units themselves and ultimately Fe dissociate into their individual components. Enzymatic cleavage and recycling of hemoglobin protein fragments occurs, while iron is scavenged by macrophages and glial cells and collected as ferritin and hemosiderin , the subjects of our next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/hemichromes.html"}

Fortunately, a large number of strategies are available for reducing or eliminating motion artifacts. These are briefly outlined below, with separate subsequent Q&A's devoted to each. 1. Minimize the degree of motion . a. The importance of simple instruction/education of the patient to hold still while the scanner is making noise should not be underestimated. Pre-scan training and practice with breath holding may be helpful. b. The patient should be made as comfortable in the scanner as possible, including back, leg, or head supports. Stabilization measures including the use foam pads, taping, snug wrapping with sheets, or even bite bars may be useful. Infants should be swaddled and their heads supported. c. For uncooperative patients or those with high anxiety or pain, sedation or general anesthesia may be required. d. Some physiologic motions such as peristalsis can be reduced with appropriate pharmacologic agents (e.g., glucagon 1 mg) given IM to prolong their action. 2. Suppress signal from moving tissues . a. Using surface coils confined to the area of interest will minimize unwanted signals from moving tissues located farther away. A good example is the use of a spine coil array which will naturally attenuate signals from the moving anterior abdominal wall due to distance. b. Spatial saturation pulses can null signals from unwanted moving anatomical objects. c. Fat suppression techniques (STIR, CHESS, etc) will null high signal from subcutaneous and juxtadiaphragmatic fat stores that are often responsible for motion artifact. d. Flow saturation pulses will suppress signals from arterial or venous blood entering a slice. 3. Adjust imaging sequences and parameters . a. I ncreasing number of signals averaged (NSA, NEX) will reduce artifacts and increase signal-to-noise but at expense of increased imaging time. b. Swapping frequency- and phase-encoding directions will shift direction of artifacts but will not reduce them. c. Single-slice ultrafast sequences (HASTE, EPI, TrueFISP) may acquire images rapidly enough (2-5 sec) to freeze bulk motion without breath holding or any additional special techniques. d. Radial/spiral sequences are more effective than those using Cartesian trajectories at dispersing motion artifacts throughout an image. e. Flow compensation (FlowComp, GMN) techniques reduce artifacts from flowing blood and spinal fluid by gradient refocusing of signal. 4. Detect and compensate for motion . a. Hardware-based gating methods for respiratory or cardiovascular motion are widely available. Respiratory expansion may be detected by use of a thoracic belt or bellows. Cardiovascular motion can be detected by EKG or peripheral pulse device. Once detected, the MR pulse sequence can be prospectively triggered to a specific time in the cardiac cycle, respiratory cycle, or both. Retrospective gating can also be performed. In this technique MR data is continuously acquired and points are reordered or discarded retroactively based on their timing within the cardiorespiratory cycle. b. Navigator echo techniques (e.g., PACE) use additional RF-pulses to track cardiac or diaphragmatic position. Information from the navigator echo can be used prospectively to trigger data acquisition or retrospectively to adjust the location of a group of slices already acquired. c. Self-correcting sequences (PROPELLER, BLADE) oversample the center of k -space and can detect in-plane rotation or translation. Aberrant slices can be rejected or realigned with the others through an iterative procedure. d. Co-registration to external landmarks or a reference image can control motion artifacts over a 3-dimensional volume.

Note: In this Q&A we adopt the convention that substances \"bright\" on T1-weighed images have short T1 values. This is true for most (but not all) pulse sequences. For a detailed explanation, click here . As a rule, densely calcified tissue has a very low water content and therefore generates a very low signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images. Therefore, materials such as cortical bone and globular calcifications are routinely dark/dark on MRI. Areas containing microcalcifications, however, may sometimes appear paradoxically bright on T1-weighted images. Two common examples are shown below. The high signal is not coming from the calcium itself, as Ca is an even-numbered element with zero spin and no intrinsic MR signal.

What do these mean, and when is each used? Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) is typically performed in three-dimensional (3D) mode, generating a rectangular (Cartesian) array of data. This scheme uses a single frequency-encoding direction ( x ) and two phase-encoding directions ( y , z ). To reduce imaging time fewer phase-encoding steps are often acquired in the slice/slab direction ( z ), giving rise to slightly anisotropic voxels and an asymmetric 3D k -space matrix. Gradient echo sequence for a 3D CE-MRA Various strategies exist for filling this 3D data array. Because frequency-encoded data is acquired automatically with each echo, corresponding data points along each k x line are obtained for each ( k y , k z ) choice. Several possibilities exist for the order and direction in which the two phase-encoding gradients ( y , z ) are played out. In linear (sequential) ordering , the slice-select gradient is first turned on to a fixed value ( k z ), and the in-plane phase-encode gradient is stepped through its full range of possible values (from  k y to + k y ). The 3D k -space data is thus acquired in layer by layer (a,b,c,d,e,...) as shown below. These layers may be acquired in any order (top-to-bottom, bottom-to-top, middle-to-outside, outside-to-middle, or randomly). In radial ordering , each k x line is acquired while the y - and z -gradients are changed incrementally in a coordinated fashion. The \"layers\" are now concentric cylinders of increasing size from the center of k -space outward. Because the number of phase-encoding steps in the k y and k z directions are usually not equal, the cylindrical segments form ellipses (ovals) rather than circles. The resultant pattern is called elliptic centric filling. As with linear ordering, the region at the center of k -space is typically acquired first and the periphery later, but a reverse filling pattern (from the periphery inward) is sometimes used. Linear view ordering of 3D- k space. Linear centric acquires data in sequence a-b-c-d-e. Reverse linear centric acquires data in order e-d-c-b-a. Radial (elliptical) view ordering of 3D- k -space. Elliptical centric acquires data in order a-b-c-d-e; reverse elliptical centric in order e-d-c-b-a. Elliptical-centric ordering is now the preferred k -space sampling method used for most CE-MRA examinations. Linear methods may still be used on older equipment and for MRA of the distal extremities where arrival of the contrast bolus may be prolonged or its exact timing difficult to predict. A vendor-specific nomenclature exists. GE and Siemens use a more generic terminology: \" elliptic-centric \" and \" elliptical scanning \" respectively. The other major vendors use acronyms: Philips CENTRA (\"Contrast-ENhanced Timing Robust Angiography\"), Hitachi PEAKS (\"PEak Arterial K-Space filling\"), and Toshiba DRKS (\"Differential Rate K-space Sampling\") \"Recessed\" elliptical-centric ordering with k -space center placed asymmetrically in data window corresponding to peak arrival of contrast bolus. In all forms of centric ordering the lowest spatial frequency points (near the center of k -space) are sampled first. These central points contribute most to overall image contrast, which is timed to correspond to the arrival of the arterial bolus. In addition to accentuating arterial signal, centric order also minimizes venous signal because appearance of contrast in the venous system occurs during the time when high spatial frequencies (edges/details) are being sampled. Some vendors allow the center of k -space data collection to be moved asymmetrically within the data sampling window. This variation has been called recessed elliptical centric ordering .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/view-ordering-in-mra.html"}

At its core k -space can be defined in simple terms: k -space is an array of numbers representing spatial frequencies in the MR image . The common pictorial representation of k -space as a \"galaxy\" perpetuates the mystery. Each \"star\" in k -space is just a data point derived directly from the MR signal. The brightness of each star represents the relative contribution of that star's unique spatial frequency to the final image. K -space is the Fourier transform of the MR image. Although the k -space \"galaxy\" and MR image appear quite different, they contain identical information about the scanned object. The two representations may be converted to one another using an advanced mathematical procedure (the Fourier Transform ). The cells of k -space are commonly displayed on rectangular grid with principal axes k x and k y . The k x and k y axes of k -space correspond to the horizontal ( x -) and vertical ( y -) axes of the image. The k -axes, however, represent spatial frequencies in the x - and y -directions rather than positions. The individual points ( k x , k y ) in k -space do not correspond one-to-one with individual pixels ( x,y ) in the image . Each k -space point contains spatial frequency and phase information about every pixel in the final image. Conversely, each pixel in the image maps to every point in k -space.

The FOV is typically divided into several hundred picture elements ( pixels ), each approximately 1 mm in size. Although the field-of-view and pixel size may vary in each of the cardinal directions, for clarity of explanation we will consider only the symmetric, 2-dimensional case where FOV x = FOV y = FOV and x = y = w . The defined field-of view ( FOV ) and pixel width ( w ) determine the number of digitized samples in k -space that must be obtained to reconstruct an image with the desired resolution. As shown in the diagrams below, FOV is inversely proportional to the spacing between samples in k -space. Specifically, k = 1/ FOV. From symmetry considerations an inverse relation also holds between pixel width ( w ) and the range between the highest positive (+ k max ) and negative (  k max ) spatial frequencies in k -space. Defining k FOV = (+ k max )  (  k max ) = 2 k max , the relationship is given by w = 1/k FOV . For most people it is not immediately obvious why either k = 1/FOV or w = 1/k FOV . So, join the confusion! Hopefully the discussion below will allow you to feel a little more comfortable with these important results. We first consider why k = 1/FOV. Recall from a prior Q&A that Fourier analysis allows a simple signal to be decomposed into a sum of sine waves with integral harmonic frequencies (, 2, 3, etc.) The Fourier projection of spatial frequencies in k -space from an imaged object follows a similar pattern, where complex exponentials (cos nt + i sin nt ) replace simple sine waves but continue to have integer numbers of oscillations across the FOV. Each pair of successively sampled lines of k -space differ by exactly 1 cycle over the field of view. For example, the spatial frequency difference ( k = k n+1  k n ) for lines k n+1 and k n is given by k = ( n+1 )/ FOV  n / FOV = 1/FOV Like the expression k = 1/FOV , the equation w = 1/k FOV is not intuitively obvious. In this case we need to think about how many phase cycles in k-space are needed to appropriately characterize the smallest desired dimension ( w ) of the image. As shown below, the answer is that one full phase cycle is needed to uniquely differentiate each pixel . If there are N pixels of width ( w ) spanning the field-of-view ( FOV ), then N phase cycles are needed. We have previously defined k FOV = 2k max to correspond to this required spatial frequency. Since spatial frequency ( k ) is [# cycles/distance], we can write k FOV = N /FOV . But pixel width ( w ) equals FOV / N . It therefore follows directly that k FOV = 1 / w . The reason these paired equations are important is that they tell us explicitly how the spacing or location of samples in k-space affects FOV and pixel width. The first example demonstrates the inverse relationship between data spacing and image FOV. On the left, the k-space data sampling rate has produced an image with a 30 cm FOV. On the right, the the spacing between data points ( k ) has doubled. The result is an image with the same pixel size but a FOV half as large (15 cm). The edges of the brain outside this smaller FOV have now been \"wrapped\" over the sides of the reconstructed image, a phenomenon known as aliasing . Inverse relationship between spacing of data samples ( k ) and image field-of-view ( FOV ) In the second example we have kept the data sampling rate and spacing ( k ) the same. However, this time we have sampled only the middle third of k-space, reducing k FOV by a factor of . With this k-space manipulation, the FOV remains unchanged, but the pixel width ( w ) has been tripled from 1 mm to 3 mm. The larger pixel size means in-plane spatial resolution has decreased, an expected result because only the central (lower spatial frequency) portions of k -space have been sampled. Inverse relationship between pixel width ( w ) and range of sampled k-space frequencies ( k FOV ) If you are still confused, don't worry. After all, this is the Q&A Tab labeled \" K -space ( advanced ).\" For those more mathematically inclined the following YouTube video by Eric Wong may offer some further insight.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/field-of-view-fov.html"}

Chemical shift refers to the slight difference in resonance frequencies of two otherwise identical nuclei residing in different molecular environments. This frequency difference arises because the resonance frequency of a particular nucleus is not determined by the strength of the externally applied magnetic field ( B o ), but by the local field ( B loc ) experienced by the nucleus at the atomic level. All nuclei therefore do not resonate at precisely the same frequency. The exact frequency of each nucleus depends both on the particular molecule where it resides as well as its specific position on that molecule. For H nuclei chemical shifts are relatively small (less than a few hundred Hz at 1.5T), but are nevertheless detectable. Chemical shifts can provide important information about the molecular composition of the tissue imaged and form the basis of MR Spectroscopy (MRS) . When placed in an external magnetic field ( B o ) a reactive response of the electron clouds around a nucleus produces an induced field ( B ind ) that typically opposes the applied field. This is called \"shielding\". The resonant frequency of the nucleus depends on B loc = B o  B ind . Chemical shifts result from diamagnetic susceptibility effects at the atomic/ molecular level. Susceptibility is a response of matter to an external magnetic field that may arise from several different mechanisms (described in a prior Q&A ). The easiest way to think about the phenomenon is to imagine that the electrons circulating around the nucleus produce an \"induced\" magnetic field ( B ind ) that opposes B o . The electron cloud thus acts as a \"shield\" to protect the nucleus from the full force of B o . The shielding factor is commonly given the symbol  , where B ind =  B o . The local effective field experienced by the nucleus is therefore B loc , where B loc = B o  B ind = B o (1  ) Older literature sometimes also refered to  as the \"chemical shift\". This terminology has created some confusion in that B ind and B loc are not measured directly. In practice, chemists measure differences in NMR frequencies between a sample under investigation and an external reference standard. In 2001 the International Union of Physicists and Chemists (IUPAC) recommended abandoning the use of  in favor of the -scale , with chemical shift () defined as  = ( f samp  f ref ) / f ref where f samp is the NMR frequency of the nuclear species under investigation and f ref is the NMR frequency of a reference compound. The frequency difference ( f samp  f ref ) is usually on the order of a few hundred to a few thousand Hz, while the reference frequency ( f ref ) is measured in MHz. The chemical shift (  ) is therefore a small number, expressed in units of parts per million (ppm) . The suffix ppm is interchangeable with x10 6 , just as the symbol % is interchangeable with x0.01 or x10 2 . The chemical shift (  ) is a dimensionless constant specific for each type of nucleus (H, P, etc) and chemical configuration (C H 3 , O H , -- P O 4 , etc). Tables of chemical shift values are readily available (now embedded into computer/smart phone applications) allowing chemists rapid identification of detected nuclei in MRS experiments. The use of ppm allows description of chemical shifts independent of field strength. Consider two nuclei with chemical shifts differing by 1.0 ppm. At 1.5T (where the Larmor reference frequency is about 64 MHz), these two nuclei would therefore differ in absolute frequencies by 64 MHz x 1 ppm = 64 Hz. At 3.0T (where the Larmor frequency is 128 MHz) the two would differ by 128 MHz x 1 ppm = 128 Hz.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/chemical-shift-delta.html"}

If a partial flip angle pulse tips less magnetization into the transverse plane than a 90  pulse does, how can the signal be higher? At first it seems paradoxical that reducing the flip angle (and hence the fraction of longitudinal magnetization deflected into the transverse plane) could ever produce a stronger signal than is produced by using 90-pulses. Indeed, if only a single RF pulse were applied, then a 90-flip angle would always be optimal. But an an MR imaging sequence involves the application of repetitive RF pulses, and for reasons described below, a series of 90-pulses may not produce the highest signal. Recall that before any RF-pulses are applied, the spin system reaches a state of thermal equilibrium with its environment. As described in a prior Q&A , the system develops a net longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) whose initial maximum value is denoted M o . The first RF-pulse rotates some (or all) of M z into the transverse plane to generate a signal. The transverse component created is [ M o sin  ] where  is the flip angle . When  = 90, all of M z is converted into transverse magnetization with maximal value M o . But we must now consider the effects of the second and subsequent RF-pulses applied after the first RF-pulse. The spacing of between successive RF-pulses is called the repetition time (TR) . Immediately after RF-excitation, the longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) has been partially or completely obliterated, having been converted into transverse magnetization. During the TR interval, M z will regrow in an exponential fashion with time constant T1. If TR is sufficiently long (the usual requirement is TR > 4-5x T1), M z will have time to completely recover and be restored to its full initial magnetization M o . But what happens if TR is not long compared to T1? In this case the second and subsequent pulses occur before M z has returned to its initial maximum value ( M o ). After a few pulses a new steady-state longitudinal magnetization (M ss ) will be established, where M ss < M o . This phenomenon is called partial saturation , meaning that the spin system has not fully relaxed back to its equilibrium condition. Partial saturation and development of steady-state magnetization (M o ) [left] TR >> T1 so there is complete recovery of M z back to M o before the 2nd RF-pulse. [right] TR is shorter and M z does not fully recover before next RF-pulse is applied. After a few pulses a new steady-state longitudinal magnetization ( M ss ) is reached, with M ss < M o . Note that in this second figure part we have assumed that TR>>T2, so that there is no build-up of transverse coherences from cycle to cycle. With this concept of partial saturation and the development of steady-state longitudinal magnetization ( M ss ) in place, we can now see why a series of partial flip angle pulses may produce a higher overall signal than a series of 90-pulses. Each 90-pulse tips 100% of M z into the transverse plane, driving the steady-state magnetization ( M ss ) and MR signal to a low level. Each low-flip angle pulse tips less of M z into the transverse plane, leaving residual longitudinal magnetization for the next RF-pulse. The steady-state magnetization ( M ss ) and MR signal are therefore higher. In summary, the amplitude of the MR signal represents a \"balancing act\" between two factors: (1) the value of the steady-state longitudinal magnetization ( M ss ) and (2) the fraction of M z tipped into the transverse plane by each RF-pulse. Although 90-pulses tip the largest fraction of magnetization into the transverse plane, they also reduce the magnitude of M z , and overall MR signal is not necessarily maximized. Conversely, partial flip angle pulses tip a smaller fraction of magnetization into the transverse plane but reduce M z less. Overall, therefore, a series of partial flip angle pulses may generate a stronger signal than is generated by a series of 90 pulses.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-is-signal-higher.html"}

If the SE is able to recover components of the FID lost by field inhomogeneities, why doesn't it correct for T2 decay as well? The second RF pulse in a SE sequence is only capable of recovering a portion of the dephased FID signal. Specifically, the SE technique rephases only those spins whose local magnetic field does not change in the interval between RF excitation and echo formation. This condition is met only for stationary spins that experience static local field distortions (e.g., gross inhomogeneity of B o , a constant or symmetrically-applied imaging gradient, a chemical shift, or static susceptibility gradient). The condition for perfect RF refocusing of the FID into a SE is not met if the local field distortion changes, if the spin moves into a different part of the field, or if the spin enters a new chemical environment during the course of the imaging experiment. For example, if a water molecule diffuses within a static susceptibility gradient during the interpulse interval, its local field changes and its signal will not refocus into a SE. On the other hand, a stationary proton in a static susceptibility gradient will experience a constant field distortion that will be corrected for by the RF spin flip and refocus into an SE. True T2 decay processes at the atomic/molecular level occur because of unpredictable time-dependent changes in the local magnetic field sensed by each proton. Accordingly, spins experiencing true T2 interactions have a random dispersal of their phases that are unrecoverable by a simple RF flip.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/does-se-correct-for-t2.html"}

In a previous Q&A we showed what happens when a long train of evenly spaced RFpulses is applied to a sample without spoiling or gradients. In this scenario, free induction decay (FID) signals will occur after each RF pulse, and SEs will be produced by successive pairs of RF pulses. Each set of three of more RF pulses will in turn produce stimulated echoes (STEs), which coincide with the SEs. An unspoiled regularly spaced train of RF-pulses will produce \"FIDs\" after each RF-pulse and an \"Echo\"-like signal just before each RF-pulse. In the above example, the transverse magnetization dies out in the middle between the RF pulses. If the pulses are applied sufficiently rapidly (i.e. TR<<T2), however, the tails of the \"FIDs\" and \"Echoes\" will merge, so that a continuous signal of varying amplitude is produced. This is known as a steady-state free precession (SSFP) . Steady-State Free Precession (SSFP) The fact that the MR signal never completely dies out between RF-pulses is equivalent to saying that the transverse components of magnetization never fully dephase. This unique situation can occur only under special conditions: (1) TR must be significantly shorter than T2, or else natural decay processes would destroy the transverse coherence, (2) phase shifts caused by imaging gradients must remain constant from cycle to cycle, (3) field inhomogeneities must be static, and (4) the spins must be stationary or motion-compensated. Although we have called the two signals \"FID\" and \"Echoes\", in reality they are more complex than this. After a long train of RF-pulses, each contain contributions from magnetizations refocused from multiple prior cycles. Perhaps a better terminology would be \"FID- like \" and \"Echo- like \". Some authors refer to them as S+, the post-exitation signal , and S , the pre-excitation signal . If care is taken not to completely disrupt (spoil) these transverse coherences through the imaging process, it is possible to use dephase-rephase gradients to refocus and record the FID and Echo signals individually or in various combinations. These methods lead to four basic types of coherent gradient echo sequences in the table below. These coherent GRE sequences will be discussed more completely in subsequent Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-ssfp.html"}

A hyperecho is a high amplitude stimulated echo that can be made to appear when RF-pulses are arranged in a particular symmetric order. The concept was developed by Juergen Hennig from the University Hospital of Freiburg and is offered as a Turbo SE option on some Siemens scanners. The special arrangement of RF-pulses in a TSE sequence is shown in the diagram below. At the center of the pulse train is a 180-pulse which is flanked on either side by a mirror images pulses with opposite polarities and phases. The inverse symmetry of the pulses after the 180-pulse exactly undo the complex rotations produced by the pulses before the 180-pulse, allowing the strong hyperecho to refocus at the expected echo time. The hyperecho has nearly same amplitude as a regular spin echo without all the intervening pulses. Surprisingly, as long as these symmetry relations are maintained, hyperechoes will form regardless of the flip angles and phase shifts of the individual pulses. The hyperecho process may be repeated several times in a TSE echo train. Typically hyperechoes are generated to coincide with the lowest order phase-encoding steps to produce maximal signal-to-noise.

Co-Registration (or simply registration ) refers to the alignment and overlay of fMRI data from a single subject with that subject's own but separately acquired anatomic imaging study. The anatomic study is usually derived from another MRI series obtained at the same session, but could be from an entirely different imaging modality (PET, CT, etc). Normalization is a similar process that aligns and warps fMRI data into a generic anatomic template. The two most widely used templates are the Talairach and MNI atlases. While co-registration is performed on data from a single subject, normalization is usually performed on data from multiple subjects . Co-registration of BOLD activation area on 3D brain image (Courtesy Siemens) Co-Registration Overview For co-registration single subject fMRI data are commonly overlaid on MR anatomic images acquired during the same session. The anatomic reference is typically from a 3D MR sequence (e.g., MP-RAGE) acquired with high-resolution voxels (e.g., 1mm x 1mm x 1mm). The voxels should be isotropic (perfect cubes, equal in each dimension) to allow the data to be rotated, re-sliced, and manipulated. Many of the same image correction and alignment techniques for data pre-processing are also used to perform co-registration. These are more fully described in the reference by Klein et al (2009) and the textbook chapters by Ashburner and Friston below. Nearly all of these methods begin with image resampling using interpolation techniques followed by rigid body transformations (translations, rotations, zooms, and shears). An optimization protocol is then employed, typically by minimizing a cost function which measures the degree of disparity between the fMRI and anatomic data after each iteration. Normalization Overview Normalization is more complicated than co-registration because data from multiple subjects must be aligned. Considerable image warping and deformations must occur to squeeze different brain shapes into a common template or reference space. Normalization warps fMRI data from one or more subjects into a common anatomic template. (Adapted from Chris Rorden) Normalization may begin with co-registration of each person's fMRI data to his/her own anatomic images as in the single subject case. More frequently, however, this step is bypassed in favor of direct transformation into the required coordinate system. Affine transforms (that include displacement, rotation, reflection, zooming, and shearing) are frequently employed in this process as are nonlinear methods. These can be made more robust through regularization (i.e., imposing penalties for excessive stretching or shrinking) or tissue segmentation (i.e., separating gray and white matter). More recently finite element techniques employing Bayesian statistics have been developed to obtain maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of deformation fields that can be optimized. Image from Talaraich Atlas (1988) Two different template systems have been overwhelmingly used for most fMRI studies. The Talaraich Atlas is the oldest (1988), based on photographs of thick sagittal anatomic sections taken from autopsy of a single woman's brain. Hand-drawn tracings of these photographs were then created and placed on rectangular coordinate system whose reference was the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line. More widely used today are templates from the Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) . These were derived from MRI scans of several hundred healthy young adults. The two spaces can be converted into one another, albeit with some difficulty, as the Talaraich brain has larger temporal lobes than the MNI. The International Consortium for Brain Mapping ( ICBM ) has adopted the MNI data as the basis for its multiple recommended brain templates for fMRI cortical mapping.

Triple IR is a double IR sequence that includes an additional third slice-selective 180-inversion pulse shortly before image acquisition module begins. The first two inverting pulses create the dark blood image as described in a prior Q&A . The third inverting pulse nulls the signal from fat. A triple IR sequence can thus be thought of as a double IR sequence plus STIR. Triple IR sequence is similar to a double IR sequence with an additional 180-pulse at time TI b to suppress fat. Triple IR sequences thus have two inversion times, denoted as TI a and TI b , and defined in the diagram above. The first inversion time ( TI a ) is responsible for nulling the signal from blood, while the second ( TI b ) allows for nulling the signal from fat. At 1.5 T, the T1 values of blood and fat are approximately 1200 and 230 msec, respectively. Accordingly, the second inversion time for fat ( TI b ) is shorter than the inversion time for blood ( TI a ). As with straightforward STIR imaging, the inversion time to null fat is approximately 160 msec. Setting TI a is trickier because the effect of the third inversion pulse must be taken into account. This third pulse reinverts the magnetization of inflowing blood, which then must regrow to reach zero again at the time of image acquisition. This means that TI a must be chosen to a longer value than it would be in a double IR sequence.

Phase oversampling, also known as \"No Phase Wrap\", is a technique to reduce or eliminate the wrap-around artifact . As described in the prior Q&A , phase wrap-around, a form of aliasing , occurs when the anatomic dimensions of an object exceed the defined field-of-view (FOV). The portions of the object outside the FOV are misidentified in terms of frequency and are folded over into the image from the periphery. Wrap-around is nearly exclusively seen in the phase-encode direction. Wrap-around artifact Several straightforward methods to reduce or eliminate phase wrap-around were discussed in the prior Q&A . These include: 1) increasing the FOV; 2) swapping phase- and frequency-axes; 3) using surface coils; and 4) applying saturation bands. All vendors also offer phase oversampling methods to control phase wrap-around, the subject of the current Q&A. As expected, the nomenclature varies among the major manufacturers: \" Phase oversampling \" (Siemens), \" No phase-wrap \" (GE), \" Fold-over suppression \" (Philips), \" Anti-wrap \" (Hitachi), and \" Phase-wrap suppression \" (Canon). With only minor variations, all vendors follow the same technique, illustrated below. The example illustrates the case of 100% phase oversampling, although the oversampling factor is adjustable to some extent on most scanners. Phase-oversampling involves four steps, performed automatically in scanner software when this option is selected: (1) the field-of-view is doubled in the phase-encode direction, (2) the number of phase-encoding steps (N p ) is doubled, (3) the number of excitations is cut in half, and (4) only the middle portion of the reconstructed image is displayed. Steps (1) and (2) maintain spatial resolution at a level identical to that before the phase-oversampling option was selected. Step (3) preserves signal-to-noise and imaging time. Although in general the phase-oversampling technique may be used without penalty, certain limitations and special considerations apply. First, phase oversampling cannot be combined with some specialized multi-section techniques (e.g., POMP), which also require increasing the defined FOV and altering phase offsets. Secondly, since the number of excitations is reduced to keep imaging time constant, the phase oversampling technique can be applied without time penalty only to scans in which at least two excitations were originally selected. Phase oversampling with a single excitation sequence can still be performed, but requires the use of partial Fourier (\" NEX\") imaging with a consequent loss in signal-to-noise and increase in phase errors. Finally, phase-oversampling will not prevent noise and motion-induced phase shifts originating in tissues outside the FOV from propagating into the imaged volume (even though stationary tissues are effectively excluded). For example, a sagittal cervical spine examination phase-encoded in a superior to inferior direction may still be degraded by respiratory and cardiac pulsation artifacts, although the heart and chest are not visually wrapped over the spinal image.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/phase-oversampling.html"}

Quadrature detection of the MR signal As described in a previous Q&A , the MR signal is an induced current generated by precession of the net magnetization ( M ) after stimulation by an RF- pulse. The signal is commonly detected in quadrature using receiver coils sensitive to magnetic flux in two orthogonal directions. Output channels, denoted I and Q (for \"in phase\" and \"quadrature\" respectively), send their respective signals along separate digitization and amplifier pathways. These signals are ultimately demodulated, processed, and recombined to create the final MR image. The quadrature receiver coils are measuring the same precessing magnetization ( M ) from two different perspectives. The signals in the I and Q channels, therefore, should theoretically be identical except for a 90-phase shift between them. The second coil permits knowledge of the exact position of M and hence its direction of its rotation (i.e., positive vs negative frequency). Another way to think of this is that with quadrature detection you are \"listening\" to the MR signal in \"stereo\". The same \"music\" is coming out of each speaker but you can now tell that the violins are on the left and the horns are on the right. In reality the signals from the I and Q channels are not phase-shifted exact copies of one another because they also contain noise. Unlike the signals, noise in the two channels is independent and uncorrelated. Thus quadrature detection offers an increase in signal-to-noise by a factor of 2 = 1.41 over detection by a single linear receiver coils. The MR signal can be represented as a vector with real ( Re ) and imaginary ( Im ) components recorded from the I and Q channels respectively. An equivalent/alternative representation of the signal is as a complex number Signal = (Re, Im) = Re + i Im where i = 1 , the imaginary unit. Its magnitude and phase can be calculated by simple trigonometry. Representation of the MR signal in terms of real and imaginary components. The designation of the I and Q signal channels as \"real\" and \"imaginary\" is entirely arbitrary. The signal from one channel is no more or less \"real\" than that from the other channel. The signal data may be reconstructed in several ways: (1) as a \"real\" image, (2) as an \"imaginary\" image, (3) as a magnitude image, or (4) as a phase image. For illustrative purposes I have processed the data from the I and Q channels separately to demonstrate the contribution of each component more concretely. The horizontal bands are phase-shifted from each other by 90 and reflect a baseline phase error across the imaged volume. Real Imaginary Magnitude Phase In clinical practice, separate I and Q channel images are never obtained, with magnitude images being used nearly exclusively for diagnosis. Phase-images are occasionally generated in clinical MRI for the depiction of flow and characterization of susceptibility-induced distortions.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/real-v-imaginary.html"}

Have you ever used an app to remove red eye from a photo, sharpen a blurry picture, or change image contrast? If so, then you have already used a convolution filter without knowing it! In pure mathematical terms, a convolution represents the blending of two functions, f(x) and g(x) , as one slides over the other. For each tiny sliding displacement ( dx) , the corresponding points of the first function f(x) and the mirror image of the second function g(t  x) are multiplied together then added. The result is the convolution of the two functions, represented by the expression [ f * g ]( t ). Cross-correlation (\"Convolution\") of two functions, f and g. (from Wolfram MathWorld) In image processing, convolution is performed by sliding a small array of numbers, typically a matrix of size [3x3] or [5x5], sequentially over different portions of the picture. This convolution matrix is also known as a convolution filter or kernel . For each position of the convolution matrix, the corresponding pixel values are multiplied and added together to replace the original center pixel. In this way the values of the neighboring pixels are blended together with that of the central pixel to created a convolved feature matrix . The relative values of the matrix elements determine how that blending will affect the transformed image. Identity Kernel: Just the starting image itself. Sharpen Kernel: : Differences emphasized with its adjacent pixel values. Left-to-right Sobel Kernel: .

These simple examples utilize 2D (planar filters), which are appropriate for black & white images such as those generated by magnitude-reconstructed MR.

The direction and magnitude of gradient fields can be appreciated by using two basic principles of classic electromagnetism -- Ampre's Law and the right-hand rule. The strength of the gradient field is directly related to the current sent through the gradient coils. The direction of the gradient field is predicted by grasping (in your imagination!) the gradient coil with your right hand and letting your thumb point along the path of the current.

At 1.5T fat has a T1 value of approximately 260 ms, so its TI null value is approximately 0.69 x 250 = 180 ms. The optimal value is often slightly less than this for two reasons: 1) adipose tissues contain variable amounts of water, and 2) a fast spin echo signal acquisition method is commonly used which includes the application of additional 180 -pulses and gradients. As such typical practical values of TI for STIR at 1.5T are in the 160-180 range. The fat suppression possible by STIR is generally uniform and relatively independent of magnetic field inhomogeneities. STIR may be superior to other fat saturation methods (such as spectral \"fat-sat\") especially near metallic foreign bodies, near tissue interfaces with high susceptibility differences (like the skull base/sinuses), and across large body parts (such as the abdomen and pelvis).

In routine SE imaging lesions with prolonged T1 and T2 have competitive effects on signal intensity (T1 reduces signal while T2 increases signal). In STIR imaging the effects of T1 and T2 are additive. This results from the fact that the longitudinal magnetization of long T1 lesions on STIR remain inverted and produce a high signal as shown below. At short to medium TIs, long T1 substances (such as CSF) are bright on magnitude IR. This is opposite to SE where long T1 values cause reduced signal intensity. Additive T1 and T2 effects.

However, the ADC map has a gray scale opposite to the DW image and this may lead to some confusion. To overcome the need to look at two separate diffusion image sets, in 1998 Jim Provenzale and colleagues proposed using an exponential image , which was simply the trace DW image divided by the b0 image.

The shape of the tissue concentration curve measured in a DSC experiment is highly dependent on the shape of the arriving arterial input function (AIF) , a(t). Without knowledge of the AIF, valuable information about intrinsic tissue perfusion dynamics may be lost. Shape of the tissue contrast concentration curve, c tissue (t) , is highly dependent on the shape of the arterial input function The simplest method to obtain an AIF is to place a region of interest over an easily identifiable artery. In abdominal imaging this might be the aorta or renal artery; in the head it often a major named cerebral artery (ACA, MCA, etc) or one of its proximal branches. If an AIF obtained in this fashion is then applied to all voxels within a slice, it is called a global AIF . However, an appreciable distance may exist between the site of AIF measurement and voxel of interest. Bolus delay and dispersion of contrast can then produce significant errors in blood flow quantification. A potentially better method, the subject of considerable research over the last decade, is to identify local AIFs arising from small arteries located very close to each tissue voxels being imaged. Voxel-by-voxel interrogation to determine the best AIF in a 1 cm region near the middle cerebral artery. The \"optimal\" AIF is generally one with a flat baseline and sharp peak.

In addition to evaluating heating around implants in vivo , MR can provide real-time noninvasive temperature mapping for thermal tissue ablation procedures and other therapies. Proton Resonance Frequency (PRF) Thermometry The most widely used method, Proton Resonance Frequency ( PRF) MR Thermometry, is based on the observation that the resonance frequency of water protons decreases with increasing temperature. The temperature dependence is approximately 0.01 ppm/C. So at 1.5T (where the f o = 64 Mz), a 10 C rise in temperature would result in about a 6.4 Hz decrease in resonance frequency. To understand why this happens, you must be familiar with the concept of chemical shift . ( See this Q&A for a quick review ). In brief, the precise resonance frequency of an H nucleus depends on its local molecular environment. Nuclei surrounded by a dense cloud of electrons will be shielded from the full effect of the externally applied magnetic field ( B o ), experiencing a smaller local field ( B loc ) and resonating at a slightly lower frequency. In water hydrogen bonding occurs when the hydrogen atom of one molecule interacts with the oxygen atom of another. During this process, some of the original hydrogen's electron cloud is pulled away by the nearby electrophilic oxygen atom. Being so deshielded, the hydrogen-bonded H nucleus thus experiences a relatively stronger local field than in its non-bonded state. Increasing temperature stretches/bends/ disrupts hydrogen bonding, leaving more H protons better shielded with correspondingly lower frequencies. Effects of hydrogen-bonding on local magnetic fields due to relative shielding of H nuclei by electron clouds. Thermal disruption of these bonds results in better net shielding, smaller B loc , and a net decrease in resonance frequency. PRF MR Thermography of a brain tumor that has just undergone laser ablation. (From Semonche et al under CC-BY) To produce thermometry images like that shown left, common practice is to use a spoiled gradient echo sequence to acquire phase maps of tissue before and after heating. By subtracting the two image sets, chemical shift effects that are not temperature-dependent are removed. The resulting phase-change (  ) map has pixel values proportional to the change in temperature ( T). The strength of the PRF method is that the recorded phase change is linear over a wide range of temperatures and tissue types (excluding those containing large quantities of fat). Additional challenges include thermodynamic changes in susceptibility, electrical properties, and blood volume/perfusion that are not captured in the model. T1-Relaxation MR Thermometry T1-based methods were among the earliest approaches use in MR thermography, and still find application today especially in fat-containing tissues where PRF methods cannot be used. In most tissues, T1 times increase with increasing temperature (since the primary mechanism of T1 relaxation is due to thermal interactions with surrounding molecules). An approximately linear dependence of T1 and Temp occurs in the physiologic range, so measuring changes in T1 times after heating allow tissue temperature to be estimated. However, both T1 and its temperature dependence vary among different tissues and become nonlinear when tissue coagulation occurs. The T1-temperature effect is reduced at high fields.

Adiabatic excitation is a special type of RF-stimulation that occurs only under certain limited conditions and produces a somewhat surprising motion of the net magnetization ( M ). A basic phenomenon perhaps more familiar to chemists than to imagers, adiabatic excitation nevertheless does have several practical MRI applications. Modern clinical imaging examples includes its use in spectral inversion pulses (SPAIR), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and for low-noise sequences (SWIFT/SilentScan). To understand the adiabatic phenomenon, two pre-requisites are necessary. First, you must be familiar with material from two prior Q&A's: 1) the rotating frame concept , and 2) off-resonance effects . You can click on each of these if you need a review. An additional required concept (presented here for the first time) is of continuous wave (CW) excitation. Continuous wave NMR is an \"ancient\" technique. The CW method was employed by Bloch and Purcell in their landmark papers on nuclear induction and used routinely in laboratories between the 1940s and 1960s until it was largely supplanted by pulsed NMR techniques. CW NMR begins like any other experiment: a sample is placed in a static magnetic field ( B o ) and its spins start to precess at the resonant frequency ( f o ). A transverse RF field ( B 1 ) is then applied in a very gradual fashion. During this process the magnitude of B 1 is held constant, but its frequency ( f 1 ) is gradually increased from below resonance ( f 1 < f o ), to resonance ( f 1 = f o ), and beyond resonance ( f 1 > f o ). As discussed in the rotating frame Q&A, if the RF-field ( B 1 ) is not applied exactly on resonance, the magnetization M will precess around the direction of an effective field B eff that oriented at an angle to both B o or B 1 . Provided the B 1 field is strong enough and applied slowly enough (the adiabatic condition ) M will gradually follow B eff during the B 1 frequency sweep. This is known as adiabatic following .

Diffusion refers to the random, microscopic movement of water and other small molecules due to thermal agitation. Diffusion is also known as Brownian motion , named in honor of Scottish botanist Robert Brown who first observed spontaneous vibration of pollen particles under the microscope in 1827. This IS NOT diffusion. This IS diffusion. Diffusion should be distinguished from other dispersive processes resulting from bulk transport of particles by the fluid medium itself. For example, the initial swirling of dye dropped into a glass of water is not a manifestion of diffusion, but is primarily due to gravitational forces plus thermally and mechanically induced convection currents. Only in later stages when the dye has become more uniformly distributed and the initial currents have subsided does diffusion become dominant. A better experiment demonstrating pure diffusion is to place the dye on an agar plate (where no convection currents exist). Here the dye droplets are seen to diffuse out symmetrically with time, gradually enlarging and fading in color. In the mid-19th Century German physicist Adolf Fick modeled diffusion as the movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Fick showed that flux of particles was directly proportional to the concentration gradient, related by the factor D , the diffusion coefficient . Because D reflects the flux of particles through a surface during a certain period of time, it therefore has units of area/time (e.g. mm/sec). D represents particle flux through a surface over a period of time, so has units of mm/sec One problem with Fick's analysis is that when the concentration gradients vanished, there should be no net flux. One might therefore erroneously conclude that diffusion has stopped. However, thermal collisions and diffusive fluxes still continue even in equilibrium; they simply cancel each other out. It was not until 1905 that Albert Einstein developed a comprehensive mathematical theory to explain Brownian motion and incorporate Fick's laws of diffusion. (This was part of Einstein's PhD thesis!) His original approach was to model the process as a statistical \"random walk\" with a Gaussian (normal) distribution. Einstein showed that in one dimension the root mean squared displacement ( r rms ) of a particle from its origin over a period of time ( t ) was proportional to . This important result thus connected Fick's diffusion coefficient ( D ) with the statistics of Brownian motion. Einstein also incorporated into his random walk theory a principle of fluidic friction developed in the 19th Century by George Stokes. This became known as the Stokes-Einstein equation , showing that the diffusion coefficient ( D ) is directly proportional to the the absolute temperature ( T ) and Boltzmann constant ( k ), but inversely proportional to the radii of the particles ( r ) and the viscosity of the medium (  ): Diffusion as a \"random walk\" The diffusion constant for pure water at body temperatures is approximately 3.0 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec. The values of D for biological tissues are only 10-50% as long, perhaps 1.0 x 10 -3 mm 2 /sec on the average. According to the random walk model, this means that during the ~50 ms time frame of a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, about 2/3 of tissue water molecules will remain within 10 m of their origin. Water molecules are distributed between the intracellular and extracellular compartments in a ratio of approximately 3:1 (the exact proportion depends upon the organ of interest). The balance between these two pools is maintained by energy-dependent Na-K ion pumps. When these pumps fail (as may happen with toxic or hypoxic-ischemic insults), cellular swelling and/or rupture may occur with dramatic changes in water fractions and diffusivity. Diffusion of water molecules (red arrows) is hindered in the intracellular compartment due to the presence of macromolecules, increased viscosity, and multiple membranes. Only mild restriction of diffusion (due principally to tortuosity) occurs in the extracellular space. In general, extracellular water diffuses somewhat more freely than intracellular water, as the latter has more chances to collide with cell walls, organelles, macromolecules, and the like. Water molecules can exchange between the two compartments, both passively (through membrane pores) or by active transport (aquaporin channels). Many tissues contain highly asymmetric structures, such nerve or muscle fiber bundles. This creates diffusion anisotropy , the preferential diffusion of water molecules in certain directions more than others. Diseases may either increase or decrease the diffusion of water in tissues. Diffusion times are often prolonged in many non-acute and chronic diseases. Remotely injured tissues contain evidence of cellular destruction, including disrupted cytoarchitecture, necrosis, or microcystic degeneration. These injured tissues to have larger extracellular spaces become more \"water-like\". In addition to having prolonged diffusion coefficients, they also frequently show elevations of their T1 and T2 times for the same reasons. Marked reduction in tissue diffusion occurs much less commonly than diffusion prolongation, but when it occurs it can have a dramatic effect on the diffusion-weighted MR images, rendering the abnormal areas \"light-bulb bright\".

In 1984 Dixon proposed a chemical shift imaging method using the in-phase/out-of-phase cycling of fat and water as described in the prior Q&A . In his original technique two sets of spin echo images were acquired with slightly different echo times: the first with fat and water signals in phase at the center of the echo and the second with the TE adjusted by a few milliseconds so that the fat and water signals were out-of-phase. Dixon's important insight was that the in-phase and out-of-phase images could be combined so that fat only and water only images could be created. The water-only image was thus fat-suppressed. Dixon's idea can be explained very simply. Let IP represent the signal intensity of pixels from the in-phase image and let OP represent that from the out-of-phase image. By definition IP = W + F OP = W  F where W and F are the signal contributions from water and fat, respectively. By averaging sum and difference data from each point, \"pure water\" and \"pure fat\" images could be reconstructed. Specifically,  [IP + OP] =  [(W+F) + ( W  F)] =  [2W] = W  Water only image and  [IP  OP] =  [(W+F)  (WF)] =  [2F] = F  Fat only image Initial implementations of this technique were not successful, however, because the 2-point Dixon method required assumptions of perfect B o homogeneity with no significant local susceptibility effects. During the 1990s numerous modifications of the Dixon technique were proposed, including 3-point methods (Glover), echo-amplitude modulation, RF-phase alternation, direct phase encoding, orientation filtering, polynomial fitting, and correction for chemical shift misregistration. It was not until the early 2000's, however, with modern magnet design and shimming techniques, that the Dixon method has experienced a renaissance. Even better algorithms have been developed including Scott Reeder's 3-point IDEAL ( I terative D ecomposition of water and fat with E cho A symmetry and L east-squares estimation), now a GE product. GE also has a faster 2-point Dixon method called \"Flex\" that can be appended to various sequences (e.g. \"LAVA-Flex\" and \"VIBRANT-Flex\", rapid 3D-GRE sequences that provide fat-water separated images for dynamic contrast-enhanced studies). Today, Dixon-type pulse sequences are offered as a standard fat-suppression technique by nearly every manufacturer, finding clinical utility especially for abdominal imaging at 3.0T. The current GE offerings (IDEAL, Flex) are described above. Siemens has both 2- and 3-point techniques under the generic name DIXON; Philips offers \"modified\" Dixon (\"mDixon\" 2- and 3-point, plus \"mDixon XD\", the latter incorporating a 7-peak fat model); Hitachi and Canon have 2-point sequences called \"FatSep\" and \"WFOP\" (Water-Fat Opposed Phase) respectively. Regardless of the details, current Dixon-type sequences all produce four sets of images as shown below: water only, fat only, in-phase, and out-of-phase. The fat-only images offer the potential for fat-quantification. A minor disadvantage is an increase in minimum TR value (required to allow time for collection of the multiple echoes). Although generally better than CHESS/Fat-Sat sequences, modern Dixon methods still have their limitations, particularly in highly inhomogeneous areas like the neck and around metal hardware. A curious artifact occasionally occurs wherein the mathematical computations will converge to the wrong substance, producing a fat-only image when a water-only image is desired. An interesting example of this so-called \" fat-water swap \" is shown below. Failure of local convergence in IDEAL sequence with fat-water swap.

In previous Q&A's I was careful to say that the B 1 field needed to be applied at a frequency near the Larmor frequency. However, no B 1 field is perfect and hence even when exactly the Larmor frequency is desired there will be portions of the image or sample that may not experience exactly this frequency. Additionally there are a number of interesting MR techniques in which the B 1 frequency is purposely offset from resonance or swept through frequencies on either side of the Larmor frequency. These situations become more understandable by using the rotating frame analysis in the previous question . If you have not yet reviewed this Q&A I suggest you do so now before launching into the discussion below. The diagram to the left is a more general form of the rotating frame described previously that allows us to consider what happens when B 1 is applied at frequency f 1 that may not be exactly the Larmor frequency f o =  B o . The rotating frame is locked into sync with the B 1 field at frequency f 1 . If f 1  f o then the B o field does not completely disappear in the rotating frame. Instead there is some residual longitudinal magnetization given by B z' = (f o  f 1 ) /  = B o  (f 1 /) You can see that when f 1 = f o =  B o , B z' = 0, which is what we expect. Together B 1 and B z' vectorially add together to produce an effective field ( B eff ) in the rotating frame. The magnitude and orientation of B eff can be determined by the Pythagorean Theorem and simple trigonometry. When B 1 is applied off-resonance (i.e., not exactly at the Larmor frequency) the trajectory of M is more complex. Instead of precessing around B 1 , M now precesses in a cone around B eff at frequency f eff =  B eff . At this point we will not go into any more detail about the rotating frame and off-resonance effects, but we will return to them in later Q&A's where concepts like adiabatic following and spin locking will be discussed.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/off-resonance.html"}

In spite of what you may have been told or read, THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN! The 90-pulse only brings a tiny fraction (not all ) of the spins into transverse phase coherence with one another . And these newly in-phase spins are the same ones that were originally preferentially aligned with the B o field before the RF-pulse. It can be shown by relatively straightforward quantum mechanical arguments that a homogeneous RF-field can never change the relative orientations of non-interacting spins. An RF-field can only rotate the spin system as a whole (and thus its net magnetization, M ). The best way to understand this difficult concept, I believe, is to return to an analogy used in a prior Q&A, \"Compasses in a Dryer \". Compasses in the Dryer Analogy A 90-pulse rotates the entire spin system including M into the transverse plane. The mild thermodynamic \"order\" that exists in the longitudinal direction before the pulse is reflected in the transverse plane as a mild form of \"coherence.\" In this analogy, individual spinning nuclei were likened to tiny compass needles each seeking to point to the north pole (symbolized by the North Star, Polaris). Because of thermal interactions (the dryer rotating), the individual compass needles ended up pointing in all possible directions. On the average, however, more were pointing north than in any other direction. When we summed them all together, we obtained M , the net magnetization (technically, a statistical \"expectation\") that pointed due North. At equilibrium prior to the RF-pulse the spin system has a net population difference representing a form of thermodynamic \"order\". The only effect of the 90 -pulse is to rotate this entire spin-distribution including M into the transverse plane. Thus what was a slightly skewed spin energy distribution in the longitudinal direction has become \"phase coherence\" in the transverse plane after the RF-pulse. After the 90 -pulse only a small fraction of spins are actually \"pointing\" in the M direction. The phases of the million+ other spins are all randomly dispersed and cancel each other out, so only the few \"coherent\" ones contribute to vector M .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/phase-coherence.html"}

It seems paradoxical, but the BOLD signal increases in response to cortical activation. Don't feel too bad, because this phenomenon was also puzzling to early fMRI investigators as well. What we now know happens is that in response to brain activation, regional arteriolar dilatation with increased capillary filling occurs so more fresh (oxygenated) blood is supplied than is required for the brain's immediate metabolic needs. For over a century neurophysiologists mistakenly believed that cerebral hemodynamics were determined by the brain's short-term metabolic requirements. This notion was dispelled in the mid 1980's by by Fox and Raichle who demonstrated using O15-PET a physiological uncoupling between brain blood flow and oxygen demand. During cerebral activation regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) does increase, but the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO 2 ) is not commensurately elevated. CBF and CMRO 2 are thus said to be \"uncoupled\". Paradoxically, more fresh (oxygenated) blood has been supplied to that region of brain than is required for its immediate metabolic needs. This \"overshoot\" of oxygenated blood means that the relative concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in activated areas will decrease. The T2/T2* shortening effects of dexoyhemoglobin will be diminished and the BOLD signal in activated areas will therefore increase .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-does-bold-uarr-signal.html"}

Such modular design is commonplace in MR sequence development: Modular structure of MR pulse sequences In an \"IR-prepped\" sequence the Preparatory Module contains a 180-inversion pulse. Other possibilities include spectral saturation pulses (\"fat-sat\", \"silicone-sat\"), driven equilibrium pulses, and flow or spatial saturation pulses. The effective inversion time and overall image contrast depends on the k -space ordering of the acquisition sequence (e.g. centric, linear) and where in the echo train the central lines of k -space are acquired. The Acquisition portion can be any set of pulses (and their associated gradients) that generate a signal: spin-echo, fast spin-echo, stimulated echo, gradient echo, etc. Recovery is a relative \"dead time (TD)\" when no signals are being generated and the system is allowed to return to equilibrium. This period may still contain gradient manipulations such as \"spoilers\" or \"rewinders\" to eliminate unintended phase coherences and unwanted echoes that might have developed from manipulations of spins earlier in the pulse sequence. After Recovery, the cycle repeats. The conventional inversion recovery sequence we have discussed can be considered an \"IR-Prepped\" fast spin-echo method.

Susceptibility is a measure of the extent to which a substance becomes magnetized when it is placed in an external magnetic field. A synonym for susceptibility is \"magnetizability\" . When matter interacts with the magnetic field, an internal magnetization or polarization (J) is created that either opposes or augments the external field. J is a quantum phenomenon caused primarily by interaction of electrons with the external magnetic field. If the polarization opposes the applied field, the effective field within the object is reduced, the lines are dispersed, and the effect is known as diamagnetism . If the polarization is in the same direction as the external field, the magnetic lines are concentrated within the object, resulting in paramagnetism , superparamagnetism , or ferromagnetism , depending on the degree of augmentation. Magnetic susceptibility , is denoted by the Greek letter chi ( ) , is defined as the magnitude of the internal polarization ( J ) divided by the strength of the external field (B):  = J / B o Since it is the ratio of two magnetic fields, susceptibility is a dimensionless number. Diamagnetic substances have negative susceptibilities ( < 0); paramagnetic, superparamagnetic, and ferromagnetic substances have positive susceptibilities ( > 0). Nearly all biological tissues are weakly diamagnetic. However, some tissues contain focal accumulations of metals such as iron, gadolinium, copper, or manganese that concentrate the magnetic field and are therefore paramagnetic . A few tissues also contain chunky iron-based protein conglomerates (ferritin and hemosiderin) that are superparmagnetic . Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) allows detection and characterization of tissue components based on differences in their susceptibilities. How this is accomplished forms the subject of the next several Q&A's.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-susceptibility-chi.html"}

Like perfusion metrics obtained other MR methods, quantification of blood flow by ASL is highly desirable but difficult to achieve. The signal intensity difference data ( S = S control  S inversion ) provides perfusion- weighted images only. Translating this raw data into absolute blood flow measurements requires three steps: 1) image processing and filtering to remove artifacts; 2) acquisition of a separate proton density (PD) or T1 image map for scaling signal intensities; and 3) fitting of data to a mathematical model to calculate blood flow on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Image Processing and Filtering Before attempting to quantify blood flow, raw data from an ASL study must be \"cleaned\" up as much as possible. Some degree of patient movement commonly occurs between the tagging and control acquisitions, and so rigid-body motion correction techniques are typically applied with co-registration and \"de-noising\" using a Gaussian smoothing filter. Segmented gray matter and white matter images may be generated and processed separately to minimize partial volume effects. More severe and random errors (such as the gradient malfunction shown right) may be identified by outlier analysis, where differences between control and tagged data are discarded when exceeding certain predefined thresholds. Oval \"masks\" are commonly generated to exclude out-of-brain voxels. Statistical techniques using independent component analysis may be applied to further reduce noise. Temporary gradient malfunction corrupts ASL raw data image Corrected by excluding affected data during postprocessing Calibration Images for Scaling PD calibration image For quantification of blood flow, arbitrary ASL signal intensities of perfusion-weighted images must be scaled to M 0b , the equilibrium magnetization of arterial blood. In theory, M 0b could be measured from a pure arterial voxel, but this is not practical because of the small size of such vessels and associated partial volume effects. Instead, M 0b is usually calculated indirectly by measuring the equilibrium magnetization of brain or CSF from a separately acquired proton-density (PD) weighted image. The PD data is converted to M 0b using corrections for TR , tissue T1, and the blood-brain partition coefficient (  ). Mathematical Modeling and Data Fitting The final step is to fit the filtered and calibrated ASL data to a mathematical model, computing quantitative blood flow measurements on a voxel-by-voxel basis. The most widely used is Buxton's general kinetic model , a single-compartment, plug-flow model whose parameters are estimated using a linear systems approach and deconvolution similar to those described for DSC imaging in a prior Q&A . The final equations for calculating blood flow ( F ) depend on multiple measured and estimated parameters as well as the precise ASL pulse sequence employed. Just to give the reader a taste of the complexity, here is the equation currently used on GE systems for their 3D pCASL technique based on the work of Alsop et al: The individual terms include: the factor 6000 (to convert units into mL/min/100 g tissue); , the blood-tissue partition coefficient (commonly assumed to be 0.9 for brain); TR PD , the repetition time of the saturation recovery proton density calibration sequence; T1 T and T1 b , the relaxation times of tissue and blood (commonly assumed to be 1.2 sec and 1.6 sec at 3.0T, respectively); SI cont , SI inv , and SI PD , the signal intensities of corresponding control, labeled/inverted, and proton density weighted pixels; PLD , the post labeling delay time between the end of the pCASL inversion component and image acquisition; LT , the labeling time, or duration of the pCASL inversion;  , the labeling efficiency of the pCASL inversion (typically assumed to be 0.8);  , the suppression efficiency of the background saturation pulses (typically assumed to be about 0.75); K SF , a scaling factor for the perfusion-weighted sequence; and NEX PW , the number of excitations (signals averaged) for the ASL sequence. The purpose of providing this equation is not to bewilder the reader, but to illustrate the multiple parameters that must be either assumed or estimated to calculate true blood flows from ASL data. A small error or variance in any of these parameters could easily alter the final calculation by 30% or more. Scaling factors can be empirically adjusted to keep calculated blood flows within expected physiological ranges, but I caution users to maintain a healthy skepticism about accuracy of values so obtained. Like other MR perfusion methods, ASL blood flow measurements remain most useful in a qualitative sense, comparing corresponding regions of the brain (or other organs) relative to one another.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/quantifying-flow.html"}

The term functional MRI (fMRI) usually refers to the imaging of brain activation using various MR techniques. By the late 1980's it was known that regional cerebral blood flow increased near areas of neuronal activity, and low resolution PET studies had already documented this phenomenon in humans. But it remained for a Harvard graduate student, the late John (Jack) Belliveau, working at the Martinos Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, to show that cerebral activation could be imaged using high-resolution MRI. John (Jack) Belliveau 1959-2014 The method used by Belliveau et al is now called dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI. Echo-planar images of the primary visual cortex were obtained before and after administration of a gadolinium bolus while volunteers viewed a flashing checkerboard pattern through goggles. By subtracting calculated cerebral blood volumes in the stimulated vs non-stimulated states, functional maps were obtained showing increased activity. Cover of November 1991 Science with an artist's rendition of the landmark paper by Belliveau et al demonstrating activation of the visual cortex using MRI. This groundbreaking paper in Science excited immediate interest in the neuroscience community, and soon research institutions around the world were clamoring for their own MRI machines. But in 1992, just on the heels of the Belliveau team's discovery, came the demonstration of what would prove to be a superior method for performing fMRI. This technique, known as BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) imaging, did not require the use of gadolinium contrast. Instead it exploited different magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to detect changes in regional blood flow Seiji Ogawa, pioneer of BOLD fMRI, c. 1990 The BOLD method was conceived and developed by AT&T Bell Laboratories Scientist Seiji Ogawa, working in conjunction with MRI investigators at the University of Minnesota. BOLD contrast was first demonstrated in rats at 7T in 1990, and was first used for fMRI activation studies in the human visual cortex at 4T during on-off photic stimulation in 1992, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA . Because it was totally noninvasive (not requiring injection of exogenous contrast material), BOLD allowed multiple cerebral activation experiments to be performed in a single sitting. The BOLD method rapidly supplanted DSC activation and is now the predominant method for fMRI used worldwide.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/who-invented-fmri.html"}

Once recognized, chemical shift artifacts can generally be \"read around\" and should not cause major difficulties in image interpretation. If one is trying to detect subtle abnormalities of the optic nerve or small renal cortical lesion, however, chemical shift artifacts may be of sufficient size to obscure a lesion completely. One simple way to work around the chemical-shift artifact is to swap the frequency- and phase-encode axes prior to imaging. Doing so will not eliminate the chemical-shift artifact but will rotate it to a different anatomical area. Such a strategy may not be successful, however, since it may cause phase wrap-around or flow-related artifacts to be shifted over the area of interest instead. A second strategy is to adjust imaging parameters to reduce the size of the artifact. This goal can be accomplished by increasing the total receiver bandwidth (or equivalently, by reducing the field-of-view or increasing the magnitude of the readout gradient). A final strategy, perhaps the best, is to use some sort of fat suppression technique to reduce the signal from fat and thereby minimize the artifact.

Discrete \"ghost\" artifacts may occur along the phase-encode direction whenever the position or signal intensity of imaged structures within the field-of-view vary or move in a regular (periodic) fashion. Pulsatile flow of blood or CSF, cardiac motion, and respiratory motion are the most important patient-related causes of ghost artifacts in clinical MR imaging. The intensity of these ghost artifacts increases with the amplitude of the periodic motion, as well as with the signal intensity of the moving tissue. If the motion is nonperiodic (e.g., peristalsis), then discrete ghosts will not be formed. Instead, diffuse image noise will be generated and propagate widely along the phase-encode direction. The spacing of discrete ghost artifacts in the image depends upon the principal direction of motion (along the x -, y -, or z -axis), the magnitude of the displacement, and the periodicity of the motion relative to the phase-sampling interval. In general, the more rapid the motion, the more widely spaced will be the ghosts. Appearance of motion artifacts depends on how they modulate the principal imaging frequency ( f o ). Random/aperiodic motion represents a wide range of complex modulating frequencies. Fourier transform (FT) results in a spread of upper and lower side bands and a diffuse, unfocused artifact. Simple/regular/periodic motion at frequency f s results in discrete sidebands that appear as ghosts on either side of the primary image. For routine 2DFT MR imaging, the interval between successive phase samples is equal to TR x NEX (because repeated excitations are generally performed before incrementing the phase-encode gradient). Ghost artifacts will be most closely spaced when the period of motion ( TP ) equals TR x NEX . Conversely, ghost artifacts will be most widely spaced when TP = 2 x TR x NEX .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-discrete-ghosts.html"}

Acute Reactions Compared to many other drugs gadolinium contrast agents possess a very low incidence (<2.5%) of acute adverse reactions. Nearly all of these reactions can be characterized as very mild, the most common being nausea, vomiting, headache, a metallic taste, injection site discomfort, warmth, paresthesias, and dizziness. Such rates are not too much higher than those occurring during placebo injection of saline and are about one-third as common as reaction rates recorded with nonionic iodine-based contrast media. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions occur in approximately 1 in 1000 cases, usually within 1 hour of contrast administration. These are more likely in patients with allergies, asthma, and prior reaction to gadolinium contrast. The most common of these reactions are mild pruritus (itching) and urticaria (hives). Prior reaction to gadolinium contrast confers an 8-fold higher risk for a future reaction, often more severe than the first. Moderately severe hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, laryngospasm, facial edema, tachycardia, arrhythmias, or widespread urticaria) occur in about 1 in 5000 cases. Seizures induced directly by MR contrast agents in epileptic patients have been reported, but are too rare to represent a contraindication for the use of these drugs in evaluating patients with seizures. Extremely rare reported reactions include acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and encephalopathy. Worldwide, a number of severe anaphylactoid reactions to gadolinium-based MR contrast agents, including death, have been reported. The incidence of severe reactions is about 1 in 20,000 and the risk of death about 1 in 400,000. All things are poison and nothing is without poison, only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.  Paracelsus The above discussion describes general adverse physiologic and allergic-like events and does include special situations (including use in pregnancy, infancy, and renal insufficiency). These important topics each have devoted Q&A's. Chronic Effects The most famous of the chronic reactions to gadolinium contrast is Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) . This is a rare, progressive, and usually fatal disorder characterized by skin thickening, painful joint contractures, and fibrosis of multiple organs including the lungs, liver, muscles, and heart. Nearly all cases have occurred in patients with chronic severe renal insufficiency. First reported in 2006, several hundred patients have been diagnosed world-wide. Because of diligence by the greater radiology community, since 2012 full-blown NSF has now been essentially eliminated as an existing disease. However, gadolinium-containing plaques in the extremities have been reported and may represent a forme fruste of NSF. Considerable recent interest has been directed to the potential for more subtle long-term effects due to gadolinium deposition in tissues. Increased T1 signal may be seen in the basal gangia and dentate nuclei of patients receiving multiple gadolinium injections secondary to gadolinium accumulation.

Phase-conjugate symmetry techniques use data from the top half of k -space to estimate data in the lower half of k -space. In 2D-spin warp imaging, the k y -direction is generally taken to be synonymous with the phase-encoding axis. Hence the generic terminology \" phase -conjugate symmetry\" is used for this type of top-to-bottom data synthesis/estimation. In theory, phase-conjugate symmetry allows one to acquire data using only half the normal number of phase-encoding steps, thus potentially reducing imaging time by as much as 50%. In practice, the time savings is closer to 40%, but this is still a huge benefit widely used in modern MRI protocols. Phase-conjugate symmetry. About half of k -space is sampled by reducing the number of phase-encoding steps. The other half of k -space is synthesized/reconstructed. Phase-conjugate symmetry methods go under a variety of trademarked names according to vendor. Siemens uses the term \" Half Fourier \", while Canon uses the abbreviation AFI (\"Asymmetric Fourier Imaging\") ; Philips and Hitachi each call their sequences \" Half scan \". GE has long referred to their technique \" -NEX \", \" -NEX \", or \" Fractional NEX \", depending on the relative ratio of acquired:estimated k -space. The term \"-NEX\" is somewhat misleading, however, because what has been halved is the total number of phase-encoding steps ( N p ), not the number of excitations (NEX) per step. Still GE name reminds us that the degree of k -space undersampling is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in imaging time. Although phase-conjugate symmetry reduces imaging time while preserving spatial resolution, this is accomplished at the expense of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For half-Fourier imaging, SNR is reduced by a factor of  or 30% less than a comparable sequence using the full number of phase-encoding steps.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/phase-symmetry.html"}

Modern diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences all trace their origin to the pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) technique developed by Edward Stejskal and John Tanner in the mid-1960's. As shown in the diagram right, symmetric, strong diffusion-sensitizing gradients (DG's) are applied on either side of the 180-pulse. The phases of stationary spins are unaffected by the DG pair since any phase accumulation from the first gradient lobe is reversed by the second. Diffusing spins, however, move into different locations between the first and second lobes, falling out of phase and losing signal. The Stejskal-Tanner pulsed gradient spin echo technique forms the basis of current diffusion-weighted pulse sequences. Stationary spins are not affected by the paired gradients, but diffusing spins are dephased. Immediately following the second DG, an image acquisition module is played out. This is typically an echo-planar sequence using rapidly oscillating phase and frequency gradients that generate multiple gradient echoes. Rapid image acquisition is generally required to minimize the effects of bulk motion (such as vascular pulsations) on the DW images. Other modules (such as fast spin echo) are possible, but are not as widely used at the present time. Modern implementations of DWI retain the basic features of Stejskal's and Tanner's original PGSE technique with certain modifications. To suppress chemical shift artifacts, all commercial DWI sequences utilize some sort of fat suppression method. This may be a chemically-selective fat saturation pulse or a nonselective \"STIR-like\" inverting pulse applied immediately before the 90-pulse. Alternatively, the 90-pulse itself may be selectively tuned to excite water protons only. To suppress eddy currents and reduce spatial distortion artifacts a \"twice-refocused\" PGSE sequence may be used. This technique employs a second 180-refocusing pulse just before the image acquisition module begins. A third common modification to reduce eddy current artifacts involves the use of bipolar (rather than unipolar) DG's. With the core pulse sequence defined as above, the following steps are automatically performed to generate DW images and their associated maps: The DW pulse sequence is first run with the DG's turned off or set to a very low value. This generates a set of b0 (\"b-zero\") images that are T2-weighted and will serve as a baseline for later calculated maps. (For abdominal imaging b50 images are often obtained, the small but nonzero gradient amplitude helping to suppress signal in vessels). The DW sequence is then run with the DG's turned on individually or in combination and at various strengths. This produces DW source images sensitized to diffusion in multiple different directions. The DW source images are combined to produce a set of Trace DW images, the first-line images used for clinical diagnosis. An Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) map is then calculated using the data from the the b0 and source images. The ADC map is used to clarify abnormalities seen on the trace images. Further advanced processing can be optionally performed, creating additional calculated image sets for analysis. These may include exponential ADC maps , fractional anisotropy images , principal diffusion direction maps , and fiber tracking maps . Examples of these various image sets are shown below and will be discussed more completely in subsequent Q&A's. b0 image Source DW image Trace DW Image ADC map Exponential ADC map Fractional Anisotropy map Principal Diffusion Direction map Fiber-tracking map", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/making-a-dw-image.html"}

They also noted similar synchronous fluctuations in the auditory and visual systems, recognizing all of these to be manifestations of the brain's functional connectivity. Spontaneous fluctuation in BOLD signal during RS-fMRI Short video overview of RS-fMRI RS-fMRI is similar to conventional fMRI, but does not require subjects to perform a task or respond to stimuli.

Typically T2*-weighted echo-planar images are obtained with 3-4 mm isotropic spatial resolution, TR values of 2-3 sec, and multi-band acceleration (if available). A benefit of its task-free nature is that RS-fMRI can be performed on all types of subjects, including infants, children, patients with neurological disabilities, patients under anesthesia, and even animals. RS-fMRI has permitted the discovery of at least 20 distinct patterns of brain connections called resting state networks (RSNs) . The most important include the default mode network (most active at rest, involved with introspection and mind wandering), networks for visual and auditory processing, executive control, dorsal attention, and salience (identification of unusual/remarkable events).

Magnetic field due to a hypothetical dipole The magnetic moment ( ) is a vector quantity used to measure the tendency of an object to interact with an external magnetic field. In NMR, the object of interest is typically a molecule, atom, nucleus, or subatomic particle. The object's intrinsic magnetic properties are often visualized as emanating from a tiny bar magnet with north and south poles (the \"dipoles\"), and is therefore also called the magnetic dipole moment . Magnetic dipole modelled as a current loop The concept of the magnetic dipole is not restricted to the modeling of atomic-sized particles and can be applied to much larger objects and collections of objects. A compass needle, MR scanner, and even the earth itself might be considered giant dipoles. When the field lines of two magnetic moments cross, a dipole-dipole interaction occurs. This is an important mechanism for magnetic relaxation between two protons or between a proton and an electron in NMR about which much more will be addressed in later Q&A's. An alternative and more quantitatively useful definition of the magnetic moment is to model it as arising from a tiny current ( i ) traveling around the edge of a loop of cross sectional area ( A ). The magnetic dipole moment (  ) is a vector defined as  = i A whose direction is perpendicular to A and determined by the right-hand rule. Like a compass needle, the magnetic moment (  ) will seek to align with an externally applied magnetic field ( B o ). It will experience a torque (  ) or twisting force given by the vector cross product  =  x B o . When perfectly aligned parallel to B o ,  will be in its lowest energy state and experience no torque. When pointing opposite to B o ,  will be in its highest energy state because extra energy would be required to move and maintain it in this position.

Cardiac gating is typically performed using detection of the R-wave since this is usually the most prominent feature of the EKG. The R-wave coincides with the beginning of ventricular systole. In prospective cardiac gating , MR data acquisition begins after being triggered by the first R-wave. The acquisition is completed before the next R-wave in a period known as the R-R interval . The cycle repeats with the next R-wave. The R-R interval in milliseconds (msec) and the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) are inversely related by the formula: R-R (msec) = 60,000  heart rate (bpm) Heart rates of 60100 bpm therefore correspond to R-R intervals of 1000600 msec. The repetition time ( TR ) in a prospectively gated sequence cannot be freely set but must be a multiple of the average R-R interval. Thus for a patient with heart rate = 60, the only choices for TR would be 1000 ms, 2000 ms, 3000 ms, etc. The R-R multiple chosen is sometimes called the gating factor. Trigger delay is the time interval between the first R-wave and the beginning of data acquisition. For systolic imaging the trigger delay should be set to in the range of 050 msec, but for diastolic imaging delays on the order of 150250 msec are typical. The acquisition window occupies the bulk of the R-R interval and is the time when MR data is collected. For most prospective cardiac MR studies, the acquisition window occupies the middle 85-90% of the R-R interval. The final 10-15% of each R-R interval is typically reserved as the trigger window . The trigger window serves as a buffer period to allow for slight variations in heart rate. That way, if the next R-wave occurs slightly earlier or later than expected, it will still be detected. R-waves occurring outside the defined trigger window are rejected. Note that the above discussion applies to prospective cardiac gating only. In retrospective gating data is acquired continuously along with the EKG then resorted and assigned various cardiac phases at a later time. The TR in retrospective gating is thus not restricted to a multiple of the R-R interval but can have any value compatible with the pulse sequence chosen. Data can still be rejected if arrhythmias occur after this retrospective analysis.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gating-parameters.html"}

Array coil systems are collections of small surface coils whose signals may be combined but generally feed into independent receiver circuitry. Small-diameter surface coils near the patient have high sensitivity but limited anatomical coverage. By combining multiple small coils into large arrays it is possible to obtain the best of both worlds  high signal-to-noise and large fields of view. The design and configuration of array coils has evolved over the last 25 years. Switchable arrays . The need for coil arrays was first recognized in spine imaging. In the 1980's only single-segment coils (i.e., lumbar, thoracic, or cervical) were available that had to be moved or changed for each spinal area imaged. By 1990 switchable or ladder spine arrays came into use. These were simply three single-segment spine coils embedded into one long padded \"CTL-coil\" on which the patient would lie. Because early MR scanners generally had only a single quadrature receiver channel, only a single spinal segment could be imaged at any one time. However, the segments could be electronically switched without moving the patient so this was viewed as a significant achievement for the time! Even in modern surface coil design, some switchable features remain. For example, because of limited numbers of receiver processing channels, a technologist may still be required to select only specific coil segments to activate when imaging the entire spine. Phased arrays . This next major technical advance used smaller coils that could be combined or fed into separate receiver chains. The term \"phased array\" derives from antenna theory where large groups of small antennas (such as in radar installations) are coupled together and used to enhance overall signal or transmission properties. As originally described MR phased-arrays employed coil overlapping (to minimize coupling between nearest-neighbor coils) and low input impedance preamplifiers (to isolate the relatively weak coupling between non-nearest neighbors). Mobile phased-array radar for military use. N independent phased array coils, each with their own amplifiers and receiver channels, will ideally increase signal-to-noise by a factor of  N. So for the 4-coil phased array pictured below, the signal-to-noise ratio should be 2X higher than that for a single coil. In practice such large gains are not usually achieved, but they can be substantial nevertheless. Four coil phased array showing overlapping coils Sensitivity map for the 4-coil array pictured above. Parallel Arrays . The last decade has seen the widespread application of parallel imaging methods in nearly all aspects of MRI. In parallel imaging, differential weighting of signals from multiple small surface coils are used to determine the spatial origin of the signal, thus reducing the need for time-consuming gradient-encoding steps. To make the complex sensitivities of these coils sufficiently distinct for spatial encoding, the individual coil elements should be free of magnetic interactions. This means that the large overlap between coils (as seen in most phased-array configurations) is generally avoided for parallel imaging and coil decoupling circuitry is essential. Thus while all parallel imaging coils are \"phased arrays\", not all phased array coils are suitable for parallel imaging. The number of available coil segments is generally much greater the number of receiver channels. This is because coil elements are cheap to produce, whereas receiver channel technology is expensive, requiring a complete chain of amplifiers, digitizing circuitry, and computational engine to process the individual signals collected. Massive whole body parallel array for vascular imaging (Courtesy Siemens) Medrad 8-channel neurovascular array coil. The nomenclature gets a little confusing, but the hierarchy to be remembered is: Coil Elements > Segments > Channels For example, consider a total spine parallel imaging array constructed of 32 individual elements  small linearly polarized simple loop receiver coils distributed from the cervical to lumbar regions. These 32 coils might be paired to form 16 quadrature coil segments (4 cervical, 8 thoracic, and 4 lumbar) that in turn could be connected into up to 8 independent receiver channels. Segments have two fundamental design characteristics: 1) They are composed of one or more basic coil elements; and 2) They are equipped with both \"decoupling\" and \"tune and match\" circuitry allowing them to be connected to a single receiver channel. Channels are independent, complete electronic chains required for processing information received from a coil segment. Channels include amplifiers, filters, analog-to-digital conversion circuitry, demodulation/mixer devices, and image processing capability. The output of each channel is generally a partial view of the entire anatomy being imaged, subsequently combined with output from the other channels to produce the final MR image. In the spine array example above there are 16 available segments but only 8 independent receiver channels. Hence it would be possible with this configuration to image only half the spine in one acquisition by electronically selecting which 8 segments to use. The 8 unused coils would have their decoupling circuitry activated, making them appear invisible to the system. Alternatively, if only a single spine region (such as the cervical region) was to be imaged, only the 4 cervical coil segments would be activated. The 12 unused lower coil segments would be detuned and 4 unused receiver channels would be turned off.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/array-coils.html"}

For brain perfusion imaging we administer approximately  to  of the total gadolinium dose as a preload before the dynamic study is to take place. The preload serves to reduce contaminating T1 effects from contrast agent leakage, especially when high flip angle sequences are used.

Rapid T2*- or T2-weighted images are obtained over the brain (or other organ of interest) in a cine fashion immediately following the contrast bolus. At present most centers employ a single-shot echoplanar imaging (EPI) technique covering the brain in about 20 slices recorded with a temporal resolution of 11.5 seconds per image.

As the gadolinium bolus first passes through the regional circulation, it remains largely or completely within the vascular space. This vascular compartmentalization of gadolinium produces a local magnetic field distortion (susceptibility effect) in the vicinity of vessels with T2 (T2*)-dephasing and drop in signal during transit.

In the tagging portion the slice-select gradient (G z ) is unbalanced, but balanced in the control. Alternating RF-phase is also used in the control portion. In a typical implementation pCASL might use 750 Hanning-shaped 20 RF-pulses each lasting 0.5 msec applied over a 1.5 second period. The refocusing portion of the slice-selection gradient is unbalanced in the tagging sequence. This means that flowing spins will accumulate an additional phase offset during application of each RF-pulse. The control sequence uses balanced gradients to remove this effect. Additionally the phase of each RF-pulse in the control sequence is alternated. Since its original description pCASL has become very popular and is currently our ASL method of choice. Compared to PASL, pCASL offers higher SNR and is less sensitive to tag dispersion. Compared to CASL, pCASL offers higher labeling efficiency and can be implemented on modern clinical scanners with only software modifications. The tagging efficiency of pCASL, however, is not as great as PASL, and is highly sensitive to flow velocity, angle of flow, and B 1 and B o inhomogeneities.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/pcasl.html"}

Welcome to the Questions and Answers in MRI Website! In 1994 I published the first edition of Questions and Answers in Magnetic Resonance Imaging , a collection of notes on MR physics I had distributed to residents and fellows during viewbox teaching over the years. Jonathan Burdette helped me update this material and our second edition appeared in 2001. These books were big hits in the radiology community, and I still take pride how many people tell me they learned most of what they know about MR physics from them. The concept was radically different from \"standard\" Q&A books. These were not questions of my own creation, but were questions actually posed to me by trainees over the years. As such, they reflected areas of common confusion that had not been answered satisfactorily by existing books and web sources. The original paperbacks are long out of print, and so much has changed in the last decade that a simple revision of the original material is not possible. So, I have decided to do a complete overhaul of all my original notes, bringing the material into the 21st Century including multimedia and other web-enabled features. I hope there is something for everyone here. There is no charge for using this site; it is my gift back to the MRI community that has been so good to me. But please don't reproduce or use any of my original text or images without appropriate credit . No doubt there are some errors and omissions, and I encourage anyone with suggested changes to email me . I will then try to correct my answers or explain them more completely.

Once the raw DCE signal data has been converted into gadolinium concentrations, the next step is to determine a tissue model to which the data will be fitted. One of the simplest and most widely used is that proposed by Paul Tofts and colleagues illustrated below. Tofts Model . The relative sizes of the extracellular spaces are exaggerated compared the that of the non-gadolinium-containing intracellular spaces (dark blue). Moreover the fractional plasma volume ( v p , beige) is generally much smaller than the fractional tissue extravascular extracellular space ( v e , light blue). Each voxel of tissue in the Tofts Model contains three components: tissue parenchymal cells (dark blue), blood vessels (containing erythrocytes and plasma), and the tissue extracellular extravascular space (EES) . Gadolinium contrast, residing in plasma immediately after injection, is assumed to leak across the vascular endothelium into the EES by passive diffusion due to a concentration gradient. The influx mass transfer rate of gadolinium (K trans ) depends on blood flow, vascular surface area, and vascular permeability. A corresponding reflux rate of gadolinium from the EES back into plasma is denoted k ep . Gadolinium contrast does not enter cells, so its concentration depends on dimensionless fractional volumes of plasma ( v p ) and the EES ( v e ) denoted in the diagram.

Tetramethylsilane (TMS) The reference from which chemical shifts are measured in H spectroscopy is tetramethylsilane, Si(CH 3 ) 4 . Tetramethylsilane (TMS) is a convenient standard because the central silicon atom has low electronegativity, the compound is symmetric, and the shielding of protons is greater than for nearly all other organic molecules. Consequently, the NMR signals of H-containing biologic molecules are shifted downfield from TMS. On the commonly used delta (  ) scale, TMS is assigned a value of 0.0 ppm, and most other organic molecules will have chemical shifts between 0 and 12. For example, water has a chemical shift of about 4.7 ppm at physiologic temperatures. Most aliphatic protons have chemical shifts less than water but higher than TMS. Aromatic compounds and molecules with nearby carbonyl groups typically have chemical shifts greater than that of water.

Sodium (Na) is the principal electrolyte in the human body, found predominantly in body fluids and in the tissue extracellular space. Nearly all body sodium exists as the Na isotope and is NMR-active. Sodium has no natural chemical shift dispersion and is not suited to spectroscopy, but can be used for MR imaging. Sodium 's gyromagnetic ratio is 11.26 MHz/T, giving it a Larmor frequency approximately one-fourth that of H. This much lower resonant frequency means that specially tuned RF-coils and electronics are needed to perform Na imaging. Na has a nuclear spin I = 3/2, so it possesses (2 I + 1) = 4 quantized energy levels and a non-spherical (quadrupolar) charge distribution. Its quadrupolar magnetic moment results in very short relaxation times whose exact values depend on the local environment: Quadrupolar relaxation due to nonspherical (ellipsoidal) charge distribution that interacts with nearby electrical fields. Even though the mean distance (d) between the quadrupolar nucleus and the lone charge (+) does not change, nuclear orientation effects the energy levels and causes relaxation. Sodium in solution . Very rapid tumbling of the sodium ion produces random changes in the orientation of its electric field gradient, with averaging of the quadrupolar interaction to zero. Both T1 and T2 undergo mono-exponential decay, with values each of about 50-60 ms. Sodium in tissues . Here molecular motion is slowed and relaxation is dominated by quadrupolar interactions. Relaxation times are bi-exponential and much shorter than those in fluids. Typical short and long T2 values are on the order of 0.8 ms and 20 ms, while the two T1 components each have relaxation times of about 25 ms. Because of rapid T2 decay, pulse sequences used for Na imaging require very short TE values (< 0.5 ms if quantification is desired). This mandates the use of rapid gradient echo or FID acquisition, typically with 3D radial or spiral data collection. Although not yet a part of standard clinical practice, Na imaging shows potential value in several dimensions: Musculoskeletal . The highest levels of sodium in the body can be found in articular cartilage, where Na+ ions are drawn toward the negatively charged side chains of proteoglycans. Sodium level in cartilage measured by MRI can serve as an index of cartilage health. Ischemia . Total sodium concentration increases by up to 50% in stroke and by over 200% in cardiac ischemia with reperfusion. Oncologic . Malignant tumors exhibit increased intracellular and extracellular concentrations of sodium. Sodium MRI may also be used to monitor the effect of cytotoxic therapies, where a massive increase of sodium signal reflects apoptosis (dead and dying cells).", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/sodium-imaging.html"}

PSIF is Siemens' acronym for a steady-state GRE sequence that samples the spin echo/stimulated echo components of the free precession signal rather than the FID. PSIF is a reversal of the letters in the acronym FISP and is appropriate because the pulse-timing diagrams for FISP and PSIF are mirror images of each other. GE and Canon call their versions of this sequence SSFP . This acronym is misleading, however, since both FISP and PSIF are steady-state free precession sequences. Philips refers to its version as T2-FFE . The generation of the PSIF signal is somewhat difficult to explain because the recorded signal is actually the rephasing of an echo created by an RF-pulse in the preceding cycle. The effective echo time is thus really TR + TE , since an entire additional cycle (of length TR ) has passed prior to echo collection. This creates an interesting paradox in that the stated TE for a PSIF pulse sequence is actually longer than TR ! PSIF image (TR=20, TE=35, =70). Fluids are bright with poor contrast elsewhere. Note motion artifacts from eyes and CSF). This relatively large evolutionary period before echo collection allows for natural transverse decay of the magnetization to occur. Images from PSIF sequences thus appear to have a prominent T2-weighting regardless of the other parameters chosen. Because T2 contrast is apparently \"enhanced\" by this technique, the acronym \"contrast-enhanced FAST\" or CE-FAST was the original name given to this sequence. For completeness, the signal intensity equation for the PSIF sequence is given below: This equation is similar in appearance to the GRASS/FISP equation given in a prior Q&A. The one notable difference is that the final term is e TE/T2 rather than e TE/T2* , reflecting the fact that PSIF collects the echo-like signal rather than the FID-like signal, and hence displays T2- rather than T2*-weighting. PSIF sequences display high signal from fluids like CSF, and in the 1990's were sometimes used for MR-cisternography and myelography. Although CSF signal was high, image contrast of the soft tissues was poor. More fatally, however, these sequences suffered from motion artifacts as seen in the image above. I never liked these sequences and never used them. Today PSIF sequences have been largely abandoned in favor of fast spin echo and balanced-GRE sequences, although some recent publications suggest that with modifications they may be useful for peripheral neurography, diffusion imaging, and black blood angiography. As shown in the example right, we are currently using a PSIF-based, single-direction diffusion-weighted sequence for spinal cord imaging with good results, although exact ADC values cannot be calculated.

Gadolinium contrast freely passes through the placenta, which by the second trimester receives 18-30% of the administered dose. The transferred gadolinium then passes into the fetal circulation where it is excreted into the urinary tract and subsequently into the amniotic fluid. Some of the gadolinium in the amniotic fluid will be reabsorbed by the maternal circulation, while some will be swallowed and reabsorbed through the fetal GI tract. A study by Oh et al. demonstrated only minimal amounts of gadolinium were detected in newborn monkeys shortly after maternal injection. Fetal anomalies and intrauterine growth retardation have been reported in pregnant rats given high doses gadolinium contrast over prolonged periods of time, but this has not been confirmed on other studies. In the first controlled human study of MRI and gadolinium exposure in pregnancy performed by Ray et al in 2016, a slightly higher incidence of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths (but not congenital malformations) was observed in the gadolinium-exposed group. More worrisome, however, was an increased number of rheumatologic, inflammatory, and infiltrative skin conditions, including some resembling nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). However, a more recent study by Winterstein et al (2022), which was better controlled to remove confounding factors such as fetal anomalies and other indicational biases, did not observe any increased risk of fetal or neonatal death or increased intensive care admission in gadolinium-exposed fetuses. Less severe disorders (like inflammatory or infiltrative skin conditions) were not considered in this later study. Out of caution, therefore, I believe gadolinium should be avoided in pregnant patients if at all possible, unless the perceived diagnostic value of information obtained exceeds these potential risks.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gd-in-pregnancy.html"}
{"id": "ddf267a1-7226-422e-a133-66a3780fe422", "contents": "Read-conjugate symmetry What is read-conjugate symmetry (fractional echo) imaging? Why would one only want to sample part of an echo? Read-conjugate symmetry is a partial Fourier technique where data in one-half of k -space is used to synthesize/predict data in the other half. The direction of symmetry is in the readout (frequency-encode direction). Because the k x -axis is commonly chosen in diagrams to represent frequency-encoding, read symmetry can visualized as acquiring data from the \"right half\" of k -space and estimating data in the \"left half\". The sampled \"right half\" of k -space comes from the later portions of each MR echo. Vendor nomenclature reflects the fact that only a fraction of each echo is sampled: \" Partial Echo \" (GE, Philips); \" Half Echo \" (Hitachi); \" Asymmetric Echo \" (Siemens). Unlike phase conjugate symmetry, the full number of phase-encoding steps are still acquired in read-conjugate symmetry so there is no direct time savings. Why would one want to sample only part of an echo? The answer is that by sampling only part of an echo, the echo time ( TE ) can be made shorter than would otherwise be possible. This is particularly advantageous for rapid and echo-planar techniques, but is also widely used in many other applications including MR angiography and T1-weighted spin-echo imaging. When echo time ( TE ) is short, the free induction decay (FID) generated by the RF- pulse may spill into the early rising portion of the echo. By sampling only the back half of each echo and using read conjugate symmetry to reconstruct the front half, we obtain an image with short TE and little interference between the FID and echo signals. Additionally, for a selected echo time ( TE ), partial echo generates a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by allowing an extending sampling time far into the right side of the echo. Because of the lower gradient amplitude associated with this longer sampling time, read-conjugate symmetry techniques may also allow a smaller FOV at a given echo time, or an oblique scan which might otherwise not be possible. A final advantage of read-conjugate symmetry is that gradient moments are reduced along the readout axis, resulting in reduced flow and motion artifacts in the frequency-encode direction.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/read-symmetry.html"}

To keep pulse sequence diagrams as easy to understand as possible, I have taken a few liberties by simplifying some of the gradient shapes in my drawings. One of my most common simplifications has been to draw gradients as perfect rectangles. A rectangular gradient shape implies that a gradient can change from zero to a positive value instantaneously, which, of course is impossible to achieve in practice. Thus all gradients should be drawn as trapezoids (or some similar shape) having a more gradual rate of rise and fall. A second gradient simplification (the subject of the question above) refers to the fact that in many references you will see a smaller downward projecting lobe in the slice-select gradient immediately after the RF-pulse. This is called the slice-rephasing lobe . This helps correct for the phase dispersion of transverse magnetization that occurs concomitant with application of the main slice-select gradient. Without this rephasing lobe, intravoxel phase dispersion would occur with resulting signal loss.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/ss-gradient-lobes.html"}

Like outer space, k -space has no boundaries and contains an infinite number of possible points. To represent an object perfectly, all spatial frequencies would need to be measured, requiring sampling the MR signal with infinite precision  a clearly impossible task. Instead, the set of MR signals used to fill k -space are sampled discretely. These data points are then placed in a finite k -space \"grid\" (or matrix) containing between several thousand to several hundred thousand cells. Each point ( k x , k y ) represents the contribution of a particular spatial frequency. Points lying along the major axes, k x and k y , represent spatial frequencies in the pure x- and y- directions of the image. Off-axis points represent spatial frequency contributions from various angles. The k -space grid is usually square and evenly spaced, but doesn't have to be. Regular spacing makes data acquisition and processing easier, faster, and more efficient. The distance between adjacent rows or columns is denoted k. The distance from the center of k-space to an edge is called k max . Both k and k max determine pixel size and field-of-view in the final image. How and why this occurs is the subject of a later Q&A . Acquired k -space data contained within the grid is then manipulated using a specially designed computer board (called an array processor ). The array processor performs a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) on the data, converting the spatial frequencies into pixel values needed to reconstruct the final image.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/k-space-grid.html"}

Susceptibility artifact mimicking area of hypoperfusion on ASL Susceptibility artifact . ASL suffers from the same artifacts as other MR techniques, including susceptibility, flow, and motion. However, some of these problems manifest differently on ASL than on conventional images. In the figure left we see a susceptibility artifact easily recognized on the source image that mimics a region of hypoperfusion/infarct on the ASL image. Coil sensitivity artifact . Spatial variations in receiver coil sensitivity may also mimic areas of hyper- or hypo-perfusion on ASL images. In the figure right, spurious increased perfusion is suggested (arrows), whose true nature is recognized by inspecting the source images. Coil artifacts may be mitigated by image filtering and other postprocessing techniques. Coil sensitivity artifact Motion artifact on successive ASL slices manifest by varying contrast and bright halo at edge of images. Motion artifact . Patient movement between control and tagging sequences often appears as a halo around the area of interest. In brain ASL this is typically manifest by visualization of the scalp. Slice-to-slice variations in brightness may also occur. Post processing motion correction is commonly performed to align the paired images and reduce these effects of gross patient motion. Slices with large position changes can even be discarded with little decrease in SNR. Downstream signal loss . A common feature of most ASL techniques is reduced signal in the slices the farthest downstream (i.e., most distal from the inversion slab). This signal loss results from T1-relaxation of labeled protons between inversion and readout. The phenomenon is more noticeable at 1.5T than 3.0T because intrinsic blood T1 values are shorter at lower fields. The artifact can be reduced by using a 3D readout and parallel imaging techniques to shorten image acquisition time. Downstream signal loss in higher slices Intravacular signal artifact . Late arriving labeled spins may not have had time to diffuse into tissue and still be present in larger arteries at the time of imaging. This may occur if the inverted bolus is not sharply delineated during the labeling process, the inversion time ( TI ) is too short, or when there is pathological delayed arrival of the arterial bolus. Large vessel signals can be recognized on perfusion images as exceptionally bright spots on the surface of the brain or other organs. In the images above we see signal in the right middle cerebral artery (blue arrow, left image) and in the superior sagittal sinus (white arrow, right image). To reduce large vessel signals, large bipolar crusher gradients are often applied along several axes immediately prior to the image readout. Consideration must also be given to the optimal choice of TI , which depends on expected vascular flow rates. TI must be shorter in pediatric patients and longer in the elderly. Although usually a pesky artifact, persistent high vascular signal on ASL can be a useful clinical sign, reflecting delayed arterial transit from vascuar disease. The image right shows high ASL signal in cerebral arteries in a patient with sluggish flow due to longstanding internal carotid artery occlusion. Arterial signals in patient with carotid occlusion Failed Background suppression . Because the differences in MR signal between tagged and control sequences are small, any motion or other changes in the background tissue can overwhelm the perfusion weighted images with noise and artifacts. This is especially true for 3D ASL methods. To reduce these effects, most clinical ASL sequences employ some type of background suppression of the imaged volume. Failed background suppression in ASL image shows abnormal high signal in ventricles (arrows) due to T2-shine-through effects. The raw data images shows how background suppression failed on the control image (middle) but not the tagged image (right). The usual method is to apply additional slice-specific inversion or saturation pulses to stationary tissue while leaving the flow sensitive component relatively unaffected. If background saturation fails during part of an ASL examination, postprocessing methods may identify and discard the affected slices, thus salvaging an otherwise unreadable exam.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/asl-artifacts.html"}

Blood monocyte 48 hrs after infusion of USPIO. Magnified inset shows USPIO within lysosome. (From Alam et al under CC-BY) Ferumoxytol (marketed as Feraheme in North America and Rienso elsewhere) is an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) approved for intravenous treatment of iron-deficiency anemia associated with chronic renal disease. Each particle consists of a core of approximately 2000 magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) molecules surrounded by a carbohydrate (polyglucose sorbitol carboxymethylether) coating, and measures 17-21 nm in diameter. Because it has properties similar to previously approved but no longer commercially available USPIOs, ferumoxytol in now being used \"off-label\" by many MR centers for imaging of the liver, lymphatic system, bone marrow, inflammatory diseases, tumor necrosis, perfusion imaging, MR angiography, cardiac viability, and plaque characterization. After intravenous injection, ferumoxytol has a long intravascular half-life (~14.5 hrs) and initially behaves as a blood-pool agent. (Interestingly, ferumoxytol was originally developed by AMAG Pharmaceuticals as an intravascular MR contrast agent, but the company instead decided to market it for treatment of anemia!) Over several hours to days, ferumoxytol leaks out of the vascular system and is taken up by macrophage-like cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system (MPS), also known by the older term reticulendothelial system (RES). Over the next week the carbohydrate coating is broken down by lysosomes to release elemental iron. The iron then is either stored intracellularly as ferritin/hemosiderin or shuttled to plasma transferrin for ultimate incorporation in hemoglobin. In the liver it is believed that the free iron released from Kupffer cells is transferred to hepatocytes for long-term storage, where it may remain visible on MRI in some patients for up to a year. Ferumoxytol produces both T1 and T2 relaxation at levels 10-20 times that of an equivalent dose of gadolinium contrast. At 0.5T, for example, the R1 and R2 relaxivities for ferumoxytol are 38 and 83 L/mmol-s, while those of Gd-DTPA are only 3.8 and 4.1 L/mmol-s. Both T1 and T2 shortening may be exploited as shown in the contrast-enhanced MRA's below. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRA. Left: T1-weighted \"bright blood\" MRA, exploiting T1 shortening by ferumoxytol. Right: T2-weighted HASTE \"dark blood\" MRA, exploiting T2-shortening by ferumoxytol. (Adapted from Nguyen et al under CC-BY) T2 shortening effects of ferumoxytol (especially well demonstrated in the liver, spleen and bone marrow) is now frequently encountered in patients who previously received the drug therapeutically for anemia. Careful history should be taken not to confuse this appearance with hemochromatosis.

To minimize contrast-related adverse reactions, a smaller than therapeutic dose of ferumoxytol, highly diluted, should be administered slowly by intravenous injection.

Although frequency components can be uniquely decoded by Fourier transformation from a single echo, the individual phase shifts contributed by each pixel cannot. This non-uniqueness of phase information can be easily illustrated by the following example. Consider two pixels, A and B, lying along the same frequency encoding column in an image, but with different gradient-induced phase shifts. Let pixel A generate an MR signal of the form A(t) = sin( t +  A ), and let pixel B generate a signal B(t) = sin( t +  B ). In an imaging experiment we measure an echo that contains the sum A(t) + B(t). We now use a fundamental trigonometric identity about the sum of two sine waves (often learned in high school math, but forgotten): sin X + sin Y = 2 sin [(X+Y)] cos [(XY)] Replacing X with ( t +  A ) and Y with ( t +  B ) and simplifying, we obtain: A(t) + B(t) = 2 sin [ t + (  A +  B )] cos [(  A   B )] This equation shows that the combination of the signals (A + B) results in a sine wave of the same base frequency (  ), but with an averaged phase shift of (  A +  B ). From a single measurement we cannot determine the phase contributions from A or B individually. For clinical MR imaging, therefore, multiple phase-encoding steps must be used to sort out spatial information in the phase-encoding direction.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/single-pe-step.html"}

As described in the prior Q&A , phase cancellation between water and fat signals arising from the same voxel gives rise to a specific artifact known as the chemical shift artifact of the second kind on gradient echo images. This artifact is manifest by a black line around organs and anatomic structures at water-fat interfaces. The magnitude of this artifact depends on the phase cycling between water and fat, which because of their chemical shifts, resonate with a frequencies varying by about 215 Hz at 1.5T. This phase cycling between in-phase and out-of-phase occurs approximately every 2.2 msec at 1.5T. (At 3.0T the cycling is twice as fast, occurring every 1.1 msec). GRE images obtained at 1.5T at TE 's of 2.2, 6.6, 11.0 msec are called out-of-phase (OOP) ; those obtained at 4.4, 8.8, etc. are called in-phase (IP) . By the late 1980's several investigators began to realize that this phase cancellation effect could be used clinically to identify and even quantify the fat content of tissues like the liver. One particularly common use of this principle today is to help in the differentiation of adrenal adenomas (that typically contain fat) from carcinomas and metastases (that do not). The diagnosis of a variety of other abdominal lesions, including angiomyolipomas, renal clear cell carcinoma, and focal fatty infiltration of the liver may be assisted by IP-OOP imaging. The technique, illustrated below, involves obtaining a pair of GRE images at the same TR but with two different TE values, one IP and the second OOP. Lesions whose signal intensities drop significantly on the OOP images are likely to contain microscopic fat. Accordingly, IP/OOP scanning is now a standard part of most abdominal imaging protocols world-wide. Lipid-rich adrenal adenoma (arrow).

Dizziness and/or vertigo are experienced by up to 25% of patients scanned at 7 T, especially when being moved in or out of the scanner. These symptoms may be accompanied by nausea or simply an \"uneasy feeling\". The phenomenon may be also experienced at 1.5T and 3T, but with a much lower incidence (< 3%) and severity. True Vertigo : a feeling of movement (of either yourself or your surroundings) when no motion actually exists Dizziness : a less specific term that may include vertigo but more frequently just a feeling of being faint, woozy, weak, or unsteady Although the details may vary, when most supine patients are pushed slowly head first into a 7T scanner, horizontal nystagmus first occurs, followed by the subjective feeling of continuous rotation in the horizontal plane. (These phenomena begin at entry to the scanner bore, the site of most dramatic change in magnetic field ( B ) and hence maximum dB/dt during table motion). Once patients reach the homogeneous magnet isocenter (  B = 0) , vertiginous sensations decrease but persist for about a minute. Nystagmus declines but never completely disappears. Upon being withdrawn from the scanner, patients experience a sensation of body rotation and nystagmus, this time in the opposite direction to that experienced on scanner entry. Balance, acceleration, and head position are sensed by the vestibular apparatus (VA) of the inner ear. The VA contains of three orthogonal semicircular canals filled with a potassium-rich fluid known as endolymph . During head motion, movement of endolymph displaces the plate-like ampullary crista , which through its connection with hair cells, generates a signal in the vestibular nerves. In addition to motion-induced fluidic pressure waves, an ionic current is always present accompanying the secretion and re-absorption of K+ ions in different parts of the VA. The vestibular apparatus showing the three semicircular canals with their bulbous ampullae. The interaction of ionic current (green arrow) and B 0 (orange arrow) creates a fluidic Lorentz force perpendicular to both (red arrow) (Modified from Ward under CC BY) A worthwhile 2-minute review of the anatomy and function of the vestibular system. Schema of the vestibular apparatus showing a single semicircular canal and its ampulla, where motion of the crista stimulates hair cells and generates action potentials in the vestibular nerve. (From Pender under CC BY) Several theories have been proposed to explain how magnetic fields generate nystagmus and vertigo (described in the references below). The current favored explanation (Roberts) uses the concept of the Lorentz force (described in a prior Q&A ) which is produced when an electric current crosses the lines of a magnetic field. Here the electric current derives from the normal potassium-based ionic current within the endolymph. The magnetic field is the main field of the scanner ( Bo ). A Lorentz force is thus created perpendicular to both. In the supine head position, this force is transmitted to the ampula, displacing the crista and hair cells of the horizontal canal, stimulating them to generate impulses within the vestibular nerve resulting in (predominantly) horizontal nystagmus and vertigo. Although uncomfortable, dizziness/vertigo can be reduced by moving the patient table very slowly in and out of the scanner. Also, pretreatment with low-dose diphenhydramine (Benadryl) has also shown to be effective.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dizzinessvertigo.html"}
{"id": "dc20f2a9-9424-455d-8954-37039db6fe3c", "contents": "Precession vs Resonance Is nuclear precession the same as resonance? No . Nuclear precession is a long-term, spontaneous phenomenon, unaccompanied by energy exchange. Nuclear resonance is a short-term, induced phenomenon, involving energy exchange between precessing spins and their environment. Precession is experienced by all particles with non-zero spin when placed in a static external magnetic field. As the earth's magnetic field is \"always on\", nearly every magnetically receptive nucleus on earth, including hydrogen in every drop of water in the ocean, is at this moment quietly precessing away! I personally find this concept mind-boggling. The earth's magnetic field is very small (~50 T) and so the resonance frequencies are likewise very low (just a little over 2000 Hz for hydrogen). MRI and MRS have both been performed using only the earth's magnetic field. Click to hear the \"music\" of protons precessing due to the earth's magnetic field. Resonance . Although hydrogen nuclei are always precessing, they are not constantly undergoing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Resonance is a natural phenomenon characterized by an oscillating response over a narrow range of frequencies to the external input of energy. Whether they be mechanical or electromagnetic, all resonant systems are able to transfer energy between two or more different storage modes. However, slight energy losses always occur from cycle to cycle, so eventually the resonance dies out. Magnetic resonance occurs when external energy is injected into a nuclear spin system near the Larmor (resonance) frequency. In both NMR and MRI, the primary source of energy input is from a rotating magnetic field (called B 1 ) generated by passing alternating current through a nearby radiofrequency (RF) coil. The nuclear system absorbs this RF-energy by increasing the relative fraction of spins in higher-energy states. Some of the absorbed energy is transferred coherently (without energy loss) to other spins in the sample, thus sustaining the oscillation. Some of the absorbed energy, and eventually all of it, is dispersed by incoherent electromagnetic interactions with other spins or through molecular vibrations and collisions. A potential point of confusion is that although precession of individual nuclei is not the same as nuclear resonance, precession of the net magnetization ( M ) is a manifestation of resonance. This is because M is not an individual spin but the sum of many. Macroscopic precession of M only occurs when the spin system is moved out its equilibrium condition by input of energy. As M returns to equilibrium through magnetic relaxation, this energy is transferred out of the spin system once again.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/does-precession--nmr.html"}

You get some very, very interesting phenomena, especially when the time between pulses ( TR ) gets shorter and shorter! To understand what happens we begin by considering the evolution of longitudinal and transverse magnetization during application of a set of evenly spaced RF-pulses as TR is made progressively shorter. Here we assume there is no exogenous spoiling/disruption of the signal by imaging gradients. Scenario 1. Pulse train with long TR Recall that before any RF-pulses are applied, the spin system reaches a state of thermal equilibrium with its environment. As described in a prior Q&A , a system at equilibrium develops a net longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) whose initial maximum value is denoted M o . Each RF-pulse rotates some (or all) of M z into the transverse plane. During the TR interval, M z will regrow in an exponential fashion with time constant T1. If TR is sufficiently long (the usual requirement is TR > 4-5x T1), M z will have time to completely recover and be restored to its full initial magnetization M o . When TR >> T1 there is complete recovery of M z back to M o before the 2nd RF-pulse. Scenario 2. Pulse train with medium TR In this scenario, TR is now the same or shorter than T1. Here the second and subsequent pulses occur before M z has returned to its initial value ( M o ). After a few pulses a new steady-state longitudinal magnetization (M ss ) will be established, where M ss < M o . This phenomenon is called partial saturation , meaning that the spin system has not fully relaxed back to its equilibrium condition. So now we know what's happening with M z , but what about the transverse magnetization ( M xy ) and the MR signals? As shown in the diagram, each RF-pulse generates a free induction decay (FID) . Every pair of RF-pulses generates a spin echo (SE) , and every triad of pulses generates a stimulated echo (STE) . Because the pulses are evenly spaced, the SE's and STE's occur at the same time coming to maximum values just before the next RF-pulse. When TR  T1, partial saturation occurs with development of steady-state magnetization M ss < M o . A series of RF pulses produce FIDs as well as SEs/STEs Scenario 3. Pulse train with short TR If TR is made even shorter (T2*) the FID following each RF-pulse does not completely die out before the SE/STE component begins to form. The tails of the FIDs and SE/STEs merge together. In this situation the transverse signal never completely disappears and the result is called a steady state free precession (SSFP) . Steady state free precession may occur when TR  T2*. Similar to the graphs above for the longitudinal magnetization ( M z ), the diagram below shows what happens to the transverse magnetization ( M xy ) as TR is progressively reduced to the order of T2 or less. Development of steady-state transverse magnetization ( M' ss ) [left] TR >> T2 so there is complete dephasing of M xy before the 2nd RF-pulse. Note we have assumed 90 pulses so that initial M xy = M o . [right] TR  T2 and M xy does not fully decay to zero before next RF-pulse is applied. After a few pulses a new nonzero steady-state transverse magnetization ( M' ss ) is reached. The combined use of gradients and phase changes of these RF-pulses will significantly affect whether M' ss is even allowed to exist, and if so, and exactly how it will form. This leads to two basic categories of GRE sequences discussed in detail in several later Q&As. Spoiled-GRE sequences : M' ss is disrupted/prevented from forming. Coherent-GRE sequences : M' ss is nutured/preserved.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/4-or-more-rf-pulses.html"}

Because of its prominence, biological importance, and relative stability, PCr is assigned a chemical shift (  ) = 0 for in vivo studies. Metabolites to the right of PCr have negative chemical shifts; those to the left are positive. P metabolites are widely separated, spanning a range of about 30 ppm. By comparison, the H peaks used in clinical MRS are clustered in the narrow interval between 0 and 5 ppm. PCr and metabolites to its right are all critical for cellular oxidative metabolism and can be considered \"energy peaks\". Besides PCr, distinct resonances for the three phosphate groups of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) are reliably visible, denoted ,  , and . Small notches on the right shoulder of the - ATP peak correspond to the energy-related diphosphonates ( NAD and UDPG). PCr reversibly donates its high energy phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) creating ATP and Creatine (Cr) . This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase and can be written: PCr + ADP  ATP + Cr When ATP is catabolized for energy, it is reconverted to ADP with release of inorganic phosphate (P i ) according to the following reaction: ATP  ADP + Pi + Energy A small P i peak can usually be seen near  = +5 ppm. (Its exact position depends on tissue pH, and this pH can even be calculated by measuring the chemical shift difference between PCr and P i .) ADP stores are too low to generate a detectable spectral peak, but the concentration of ADP can be estimated by calculating the ratio [P i ]/[PCr]. With the exception of Pi, all the peaks to the left of PCr derive from metabolites related to membrane phospholipids. These \"membrane peaks\" can be divided into two major groups: Phosphomonoesters (PMEs) and Phosphodiesters (PDEs) . Although not completely correct, PMEs are often thought of as primarily reflecting membrane synthesis, with PDEs reflecting membrane breakdown.

As described in the prior Q&A , the strongly electronegative oxygen atom of a water molecule pulls away the protective electron clouds covering the hydrogen nuclei. This deshielding effect exposes the hydrogen protons to a relatively stronger local magnetic field than they would otherwise experience. Hence they resonate slightly faster than the more shielded protons in triglyceride (fat) molecules. This difference in resonance frequencies between water and fat increases with increasing magnetic field strength through a scaling factor called the chemical shift . Deshielding of hydrogen nuclei in water by electronegative oxygen The chemical shift between fat and water has been measured to be approximately 3.5 parts per million (ppm) . The suffix ppm is interchangeable with x10 6 , just as the symbol % is interchangeable with 1/100, x0.01 or x10 2 . The chemical shift is given as a ratio because the actual frequency difference (in Hz) will depend upon the applied magnetic field. Calculating the actual fat-water frequency difference is easy  you simply multiply the Larmor frequency at whatever field strength you are using by 3.5 ppm or 3.5 x 10 6 . Spectral peaks for fat and water over a large anatomic area broadened due to inhomogeneity effects. The average chemical shift difference is about 3.5 ppm. In a 1.5T scanner (operating at 64 MHz), the fat-water frequency difference (f) will therefore be f = (64 MHz)(3.5 ppm) = (64 x 10 6 Hz)(3.5 x10 6 )  220 Hz At 3.0T where the Larmor frequency is 128 MHz, the fat-water frequency shift would be twice as large, or about 440 Hz.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/f-w-chemical-shift.html"}

Multi-nuclear spectroscopy (MNS) refers to the use of nuclei besides hydrogen ( H) for NMR studies. Organic molecules typically contain several such nuclei with non-zero spins that are \"NMR-active\". However, the ability to acquire an adequate signal or spectrum from these nuclei depend on at least three additional factors: Natural Abundance . The NMR-active isotope of a given nucleus may or may not be the most abundant form found biological tissues. The natural abundance of H and P is close to 100%, so the NMR signals from these elements are strong. By comparison, only 1% of carbon exists as the NMR-active isotope C, so only a weak signal is produced. Relative Sensitivity . The strength of a nuclear signal is proportional to  ( I )( I + 1 ) where  is the gyromagnetic ratio and I is the nuclear spin. Relative sensitivity compares the signal of a nucleus to H nuclei under identical conditions (which is given a value of 1.0). The product {natural abundance} x {relative sensitivity} is called nuclear receptivity and reflects the overall ease of acquiring an NMR signal. Quadrupolar Relaxation . Nuclei with spins >  (such as Na) have non-spherical charge distributions and undergo accelerated T1 and T2 relaxation, making their signals difficult to detect.

A baseline b-value of 50 s/mm is often used in liver diffusion-weighted imaging instead of b = 0. The reason is readily apparent from the images below. With b = 0 bright signals are noted in multiple veins due to the high T2 of blood coupled with sluggish flow. This array of multiple white dots on the b0 image makes distinguishing cysts, masses, and vessels difficult. By raising the starting b-value to a low number like 50-100, these vascular white dots disappear, providing a cleaner visualization of the hepatic parenchyma. The reason the vascular dots disappear with low b-values is that flowing protons within them have moved to a different position in the gradient field.

MR imaging is increasingly performed using arrays of small surface coils placed near or on the body, often in conjunction with parallel imaging. The advantage of using small surface coils is that they produce a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) than would be possible from a larger, more distant coil. The disadvantage is non-uniformity of signal. The depth of penetration of coils is inversely proportional to their diameters. Signals arising superficially in the patient are accentuated, while those deep to the patient are attenuated. The resultant bright surface signal is sometimes referred to as surface coil \"flare\" . Signal to noise ratio for coils of various sizes. The sensitivity of surface coils falls off significantly with increasing depth away from the surface. Surface coil spine image showing surface coil \"flare\" with overly bright subcutaneous fat. The deeper tissues have relatively low signal and are poorly visualized. Same image as left, post-processed with SCIC (Surface Coil Intensity Correction) algorithm. Note more uniform contrast throughout the image. The simplest solution to surface coil flare is to apply a post-processing filter to the reconstructed image. Such filters correct for low spatial frequency intensity modulations, enhance image contrast, and reduce noise. They are known generically known as SCIC (Surface Coil Intensity Correction) . Some version of SCIC is offered by every vendor, and as a rule should be routinely used, especially for spine, extremity, and body imaging. Intensity correction filters should NOT be used, however, when quantitative data is needed, such as for quality assurance/ SNR measurements, T2-cartilage mapping, functional MRI, etc. For multichannel parallel imaging it is possible to make corrections for non-uniform receiver coil profiles prior to imaging. These methods are known under different vendor tradenames: GE's ( PURE - \"Phased array Uniformity Enhancement\"), Siemens' ( Prescan Normalize ), Philips' ( CLEAR - \"Constant LEvel AppeaRance\"), and Hitachi's ( NATURAL - \"NATural Uniformity Realization Algorithm\").

Net magnetization (M), the averaged sum of many individual quantum spins, can be treated as a regular vector in classical physics. Fortunately, nearly all the ideas behind MRI can be explained in terms of classical physics. Having an appreciation for quantum mechanics adds a certain perspective but is largely unnecessary. Although particle physicists must address the quantum world regularly, those involved with clinical or research MRI seldom do. The reason is straightforward  During an MRI experiment we are not looking at the signal from individual nuclei, but from millions to billions in the aggregate. As shown in the diagram above, it is preferable not to think about individual nuclei (with their \"freaky\" quantum behavior). Instead you should think about the sum of their magnetic properties averaged together to create a net magnetization (M) . Net magnetization ( M ) behaves as a \"regular\" vector using the principles of classical physics. From this point forth we will almost exclusively use the vector M rather than individual nuclear spins when explaining aspects of NMR and MRI. At equilibrium (i.e., when no scanning is taking place) M is aligned with the main magnetic field ( B o ). However, during the MR imaging M is purposely tipped out of alignment allowing it to precess around the direction of B o (just as the individual spins that compose M also precess around B o ). The direction of the B o field is commonly designated as the z -axis. Using this coordinate system, M can be considered to have both longitudinal ( M z ) and transverse ( M xy ) components. Since M is precessing, in general M z and M xy will be a function of time. The net magnetization (M) is a vector that can be resolved into components longitudinal (Mz) and transverse (Mxy) with respect to the main magnetic field (Bo). At rest (between imaging sequences) M is aligned with Bo and hence Mz = Mo us a maximum and Mxy=0.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/net-magnetization-m.html"}

Fast spin echo (FSE) imaging, also known as Turbo spin echo (TSE) imaging, are commercial implementations of the RARE ( R apid A cquisition with R elaxation E nhancement) technique originally described by Hennig et al in 1986. Since that time FSE/TSE has grown to become one of the \"workhorse\" pulse sequences used in virtually all aspects of modern MR imaging. The FSE/TSE pulse sequence (illustrated above) superficially resembles a conventional spin-echo (CSE) sequence in that it uses a series of 180-refocusing pulses after a single 90-pulse to generate a train of echoes. In shorthand notation CSE: 90180echo                90180echo  FSE: 90180echo 180echo 180echo 180echo      90180echo  The FSE/TSE technique, however, changes the phase-encoding gradient for each of these echoes (a conventional multi-echo sequence collects all echoes in a train with the same phase encoding). As a result of changing the phase-encoding gradient between echoes, multiple lines of k -space (i.e., phase-encoding steps) can be acquired within a given repetition time ( TR ). Because of multiple phase-encoding lines are acquired during each TR interval, FSE/TSE techniques may significantly reduce imaging time. The number of echoes acquired in a given TR interval is known as the echo train length ( ETL ) or turbo factor . The ETL typically ranges from 4 to 32 for routine imaging, but may exceed 200 for rapid imaging/echo planar techniques. When the number of slices is not the limiting factor, imaging time is inversely proportional to ETL . That is, an FSE/TSE sequence with an ETL =8 can be performed in one-eighth the time of a conventional SE sequence with the same TR . In addition to speed, FSE techniques offer other advantages. First, the significant time savings by scanning multiple lines of k -space may be used to lengthen TR , allowing more time for recovery of longitudinal magnetization and hence improved signal-to-noise. A higher number of phase-encoding steps may be used, allowing improvement in spatial resolution. Finally, susceptibility-induced signal losses are reduced, making FSE superior to CSE for imaging the skull base and around metal objects. Reduction of magnetic susceptibility artifacts may be disadvantageous, however, as FSE images are less likely to detect small areas of calcification or hemorrhage. Other limitations of FSE include overly bright signals from fat on T2-weighted images and overly bright CSF on spin-density-weighted images. Increased tissue heating secondary to multiple 180-pulses may also limit FSE use in infants and and small children.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-is-fsetse.html"}

The terms linear polarization (LP) and circular polarization (CP) derive from classical electromagnetic theory describing two modes of wave propagation. Readers may be more familiar with these concepts from optics, where polarizing lenses like those used in sunglasses allow light rays oscillating in a specified constrained (linear) dimension to pass through while blocking all others. The diagrams below illustrate CP and LP of wave propagation. Circular polarization Linear polarization LP vs CP (Quadrature) Coil Configurations The earliest RF-coils for MR imaging were all linearly polarized (LP). In this configuration, both transmission and reception of electro-magnetic radiation took place along a single axis. In the transmit mode LP coils are inefficient in that half their power is wasted. In the receiver mode they are incapable of extracting full phase information from the the MR signal. The above illustration shows a Helmholz pair of coils on the left arranged in a linearly polarized (LP) configuration. The B 1 RF-field (green arrows) is generated by driving the coils with a sinusoidal electric current, causing B 1 to oscillate back and forth in a single direction. As explained in the previous question , any linearly oscillating field can be decomposed into 2 counter-rotating circular fields, one in the same direction and frequency as the NMR spin system and the other in the opposite direction. The oppositely rotating field constitutes \"wasted\" RF-power that does not affect the spin system and creates the adverse affect of heating tissues. By adding a second set of coils perpendicular to the first and driving them with sinusoidal current phase shifted by 90, a pure rotating B 1 field can be created. This is known as circularly polarized (CP) or quadrature transmission . The unwanted counter-rotating fields from each linear coil set (denoted by red arrows below) are always 180 out of phase and hence cancel each other out. The useful subfields in sync with the spin system (blue arrows) add together vectorially to produce a rotating B 1 field with no wasted power. Vector diagram of two linearly polarized coils placed in quadrature. Each is driven by a sinusoidal current, but Coil 2 is 90 out of phase with Coil 1. The oscillating field from each coil can be decomposed into vectors rotating in the same direction as the spin system (blue arrows) and in the opposite direction (red arrows). When added together the net effect is a rotating B1 field without wasted power. Like LP coils, CP coils can be used as transmitters, receivers, or both.

Adipose tissue is predominantly composed of long-chain triglycerides and free fatty acids, whose prinicipal resonances lie between  = 0.9 and 1.4 ppm. Signal from extraneous fat can \"bleed into\" and contaminate the spectra from within the defined volume of interest. Lactate at  = 1.3 is especially affected. Lipid contamination is particularly problematic in breast MRS (since the normal breast contains large amount of fat) and for prostate MRS (since the prostate is a small organ surrounded in pelvic fat). In brain MRS, scalp and marrow fat can affect the spectra from voxels obtained near the brain surface. The most common method to eliminate unwanted fat signal is to place multiple saturation bands over lipid-containing regions. This method is known as outer volume suppression (OVS). OVS bands are spatially but not frequency specific, reducing or eliminating signals from all tissues (not just lipids). They can be even thicker than the ones shown in the figure and brought down close to the edges of a single voxel even at the center of the brain, completely surrounding it. They are also commonly placed in the planes above and below the volume of interest (not illustrated). Outer volume suppression bands Inversion recovery (IR) method for fat suppression OVS bands are usually sufficient for brain spectroscopy, but for body applications (especially prostate, breast and skeletal muscle MRS) additional fat suppression methods may be necessary. Inversion recovery methods widely used in conventional MR imaging may be employed, including STIR (Short TI Inversion Recovery) and SPIR ( Spectral Presaturation with Inversion Recovery) . A current popular choice is SPAIR (SPectral Attenuated Inversion Recovery) , described more completely in a prior Q&A . SPAIR begins with a frequency-selective, 180-adiabatic pulse that inverts the longitudinal magnetization of fat. A time delay (~165 ms at 1.5T, ~200 ms at 3.0T) is interposed so that fat magnetization partially recovers to pass through zero at the time of spectroscopic excitation. The frequency band of the SPAIR pulse must include principal fat resonances at 0.9 and 1.3 ppm, and thus will obscure metabolites in this region of the spectrum, including lactate at  = 1.33.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fat-suppression.html"}
{"id": "17e768e0-4806-458f-a929-52ab5181e7e4", "contents": "Dipole-Dipole Interactions Can you explain a little more about the dipole-dipole interaction? I still don't quite understand. The concept of the magnetic dipole has been introduced in a prior Q&A . In brief, protons, electrons, and NMR-active nuclei can be thought of as tiny magnets with north and south poles (\" dipoles \") whose electromagnetic fields interact through space. This interaction is called a dipole-dipole interaction is the most important single mechanism responsible for T1 and T2 relaxation in biological tissues. A spinning particle (proton, electron, or whole nucleus) modeled as a \"dipole\" that generates its own local magnetic field. Four major factors determine the strength of the dipolar interaction: (1) types of spins; (2) the distance between them; (3) the angle between them; and (4) their relative motion. Types of spins : Dipole-dipole interactions may be either proton-proton or proton-electron. Due to its small size, an electron has a much larger gyromagnetic ratio ( ) than a proton and so a proton-electron dipolar interaction is much more powerful than a proton-proton interaction. This is the reason paramagnetic substances like Gd+3 with multiple unpaired electrons are so effective at inducing magnetic relaxation. \"Through-space\" Interaction of magnetic fields from two spinning particles via the dipole-dipole mechanism. Distance : The strength of the dipolar interaction depends on the distance between the spins. The effect is inversely proportional to the sixth power of distance (1/r 6 ), explaining why short-range intramolecular dipole-dipole interactions are more powerful than long-range intermolecular ones. This generally means that two H nuclei must approach within about 0.3 nm of each other to be effective at dipole-dipole interactions. If one of the dipoles is an electron or paramagnetic ion, then the distances up to 1 nm may still be effective. In pure water it is estimated that about 70% of the dipolar interactions are intra molecular while 30% are inter molecular. Angle : The strength of the dipolar interaction also depends on the quantity ( 3 cos   1 ), where  is the angle between the two spins. This leads to the interesting property that the static component of dipole-dipole interaction vanishes when   54.7. This is the so-called magic angle , the value of  that makes the term ( 3 cos   1 ) = 0 . This phenomenon affects primarily T2 relaxation and explains why portions of tendons, nerves, and cartilage may have paradoxically high signal on routine musculoskeletal MR imaging if they make an angle of 54.7 with the main magnetic field. The details of this magic angle phenomenon will be described in a subsequent Q&A . Relative motion : How the spins move relative to one another is a strong determinant of the degree and type of relaxation (combined T1/T2 or T2 alone). If one of the spins resides on a molecule that is tumbling or rotating at frequency , its associated dipolar field will also fluctuate at the same frequency. If that frequency happens to closely match the Larmor frequency, then conditions are optimal to cause T1 relaxation in a nearby spin. Conversely, if the molecule on which the spin resides is hardly moving at all (as in large molecules fixed in cell membranes) the dipolar field will be relatively static, producing dephasing of nearby spins and predominantly T2 relaxation. A qualitative appreciation of how molecular motion of a dipolar pair causes locally fluctuating fields can be seen by considering the rotation of a water molecule (HOH) in the diagrams below. Each H nucleus is a dipole generating its own localized magnetic field. The magnitude of such local fields are quite small, on the order of 7 gauss over typical intramolecular distances of 0.2-0.3 nm. As the molecule rotates these local fields interact with one another. For ease of explanation let us assume that the light red H nucleus remains stationary as the dark red H nucleus rotates around it. As it rotates the dark red H nucleus experiences a local field that fluctuates by 7 gauss. The frequency of this local field fluctuation is directly related to the rate of molecular rotation. The local magnetic field near a hydrogen nucleus varies by  7 gauss (G) according to location. Dark red hydrogen nucleus experiences a magnetic field fluctuation of 7G at a frequency determined by the molecular tumbling rate. T1 relaxation is most efficient at Larmor frequency ( f o ). T1 Relaxation Effect . When this molecular \"tumbling\" rate is close to the Larmor frequency (f o ), then the fluctuating magnetic field from one spin is optimal for inducing T1 relaxation in the other. The relationship between T1 and molecular tumbling rate is illustrated to the right. In this figure we see that water, with its small molecular size, tumbles much too rapidly in its free state to be effective at T1 relaxation. T1 values are longer for free water than for any other substance in the body (approximately 4000 ms at 1.5T). When the water is in a partially bound or in a restricted state, however, its tumbling may be slowed to a rate much closer to the Larmor frequency. Water molecules with restricted motion frequently occur in biological systems where their molecular motion is slowed by interaction with polar amide and hydroxyl groups on the surfaces of macromolecules. The T1 value of \"bound\" or \"structured\" water is therefore much shorter than that of free water (typically about 400-800 ms at 1.5T). This is the type of water whose signal we primarily measure when imaging solid organs like the liver or brain. For completeness the graph shows that as molecular rotation rates slow below the Larmor frequency, the fluctuating dipolar fields are no longer efficient at inducing relaxation and T1 values again increase. If we measured the T1 value of ice, for example, as might form during a cryoablation procedure, we would find it to be very several seconds or more. Ice has extremely long T1 values because in the crystalline state its molecular motions are much slower than the Larmor frequency. Certain (non-biologic) solid crystals have been reported to have T1 values of weeks to months! T2 Relaxation Effect . As the rate of molecular rotation falls below the Larmor frequency, local fields created by each spin fluctuate less and less and assume an increasingly static character. The z -component of a slowly fluctuating field ( B z ) from one dipole (  ) augments or subtracts from the main field ( B o ) at the site of the other dipole. The second dipole then precesses at a slightly lower or higher frequency, gaining or losing phase in the process. This mechanism of dipolar interaction results in T2 relaxation without T1 relaxation. As the solid state is attained, all molecular rotations and translations largely cease and so the static mechanism predominates, resulting in very short T2 values. The z-component from one dipole ( B z ) adds to the B o field at the second dipole, changing its precession frequency slightly. This results in T2 relaxation. The combined graph to the left shows how T2 relaxation time varies as a function of molecular tumbling rate. As expected, T2 becomes very short as the solid state is approached. The small plateau in the T2 curve (accentuated in the diagram for didactic purposes) at the Larmor frequency represents the effect of T1 on T2 relaxation.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/dipole-dipole-interactions.html"}

Even-echo rephasing is a flow phenomenon that is observed in SE images in which multiple evenly spaced echoes (e.g., 25/50/75/100) have been acquired. For blood flowing at constant velocity in such an environment, phase dispersion is lower on the even-numbered echoes (i.e., 50/100) than on the odd echoes (i.e., 25/75). The absolute increase in flow signal on the second and fourth echoes is called even-echo rephasing ; the loss in signal on the first and third echoes is called odd-echo dephasing . Odd-echo dephasing (TE=25 and 75) and even-echo rephasing (TE=50 and 100) noted in the internal cerebral veins (arrows). The veins' signals are increased on the even numbered echoes. This modulation of signal by echo number is caused by the frequency-encoding gradient. Hence this phenomenon is typically seen in vessels flowing within an imaging plane and having some component of flow in the frequency-encode direction. The internal cerebral veins pictured above are running exactly in the frequency-encode direction, explaining why the phenomenon is so prominent in these vessels. Even-echo rephasing and odd-echo dephasing derive from the fact explained in a prior Q&A that steady flow in a constant gradient results in a phase shift that is quadratic in time.

Radiofrequency (RF) fields are part of the electromagnetic spectrum suitable for communication purposes, often cited to lie between about 3 kHz and 300 GHz. According to Maxwell's Laws, a changing magnetic field ( B ) is always accompanied by a changing electric field ( E ), and vice-versa. So the transmitted RF irradiation in MRI necessarily includes both B and E field components, which interact not only with nuclei, but with electrons, ions, atoms, and whole molecules simultaneously. Thus a wide range of potential effects of RF-field must be considered. These are normally classified as either non- thermal or thermal. Non-Thermal Effects Considerable controversy exists concerning whether non-ionizing irradiation in the RF spectrum causes genetic, cellular, or physiologic damage unrelated to tissue heating. Theoretical mechanisms of non-thermal injury include generation of reactive oxygen species (\"oxidative stress\") and alteration of calcium flux across cell membranes. Most research into this topic has focused on long-term or high intensity exposures, often at frequencies higher or lower than those used in MRI. Even the greatest skeptics would likely agree that non-thermal effects, even if they exist, are unlikely to be significant in the MRI setting. These issues are discussed in more detail with extensive references in another Q&A . Thermal Effects By contrast, thermal effects are universally recognized to produce a large number of potential biological changes, including impaired thermoregulation, alteration of chemical reaction rates, pain, and burns. Although most readers are probably aware that these effects exist, they may be surprised to learn the following: Only a tiny fraction (< 2%) of transmitted RF power is actually absorbed by nuclei. The absorbed nuclear energy transferred to the \"lattice\" via T1 relaxation makes a non-significant contribution to tissue heating. The coexistent electric field ( E ) -- not the magnetic field ( B 1 )  is responsible for nearly all thermal effects in MRI. More about the Electric Field (E) The time-dependent E and B 1 fields are related by the Faraday-Maxwell equation which can be written in differential form as:   E =  B 1 / t . The left hand side of this equation contains a vector operator called \"the curl\" (  ) , while the right hand side is a \"derivative\" (  /t), representing the time rate of change of B 1 . The electric ( E ) field can thus be visualized as \"curling around\" the magnetic ( B 1 ) field in concentric loops, whose properties depend on the instantaneous magnitude, direction, and time rate of change of B 1 . Both fields oscillate at the same frequency (  o = 2f o ), so the direction of E is rapidly switching from clockwise to counterclockwise in each cycle. Relation of magnetic ( B 1 ) and electric ( E ) fields as defined by the Faraday-Maxwell equation. The lines of the E field \"curl\" around the B 1 field. The direction of E is defined as the direction a hypothetical positive charge would move (or an electric current would flow) at a given point in space and time. The E field deposits energy into tissues by two basic mechanisms: 1) resistive heating and 2) dielectric heating . Resistive Heating Pure water is a poor conductor, but biological tissues, which contain water plus dissolved electrolytes, conduct currents fairly well. The charge carriers in tissue are principally Na+, K+, Cl, and HCO 3  ions. Voltage gradients in the electric field accelerate these ions, imparting them with kinetic energy and creating an induced current. When these charge carriers collide inelastically with other ions, atoms, or molecules, their kinetic energy is transferred into random vibrational energy ( thermal heat ). This process is analogous to resistive loss of energy in a conventional electrical circuit governed by Ohm's Law. It is therefore alternatively referred to as Joule, Resistive, or Ohmic heating . Dielectric Heating The water molecule is polar due to its electronegative O atom Many molecules in the body are polar, especially water, based on its highly electronegative oxygen component. Polar molecules tend to align with an externally applied electric field. When the field changes, so do their orientations. In a rapidly changing RF E -field as exists in MRI, these rotating dipoles push and collide with other molecules, dispersing their kinetic energy as heat. This mechanism is effective over a large range of frequencies and is the same principle by which microwave ovens warm food. The relative contributions of resistive and dielectric heating are difficult to separate out experimentally, as tissues are three dimensional and contain various components with different resistances and dielectric properties. It is generally believed that resistive heating is the more important mechanism at field strengths used in MRI, becoming progressively more dominant as radio frequencies increase.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/rf-biological-effects.html"}

Gadolinium-containing contrast agents do not normally enter the extracellular spaces of the brain and spinal cord, being excluded by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) . The BBB is formed by tight junctions between endothelial cells, allowing movement of only ions and small molecules (like O 2 ) across the vessel wall. If the BBB becomes disrupted by disease (such as malignant tumors and infections), contrast agents will leak into the brain parenchyma producing T1 shortening and enhancement. Tight endothelial junctions along the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevent intravascular gadolinium contrast from entering the extracellular space of the brain. (From Wikipedia) Accumulation of contrast in tissue due to a leaky BBB violates a fundamental assumption of the simple tracer kinetic model on which DSC imaging is based  that no pooling or retention of contrast agent occurs. In the presence of BBB disruption, blood flow/volume estimates may be significantly in error. Two effects of T1-shortening due to gadolinium accumulation confound DSC perfusion imaging: Blunting of T2* signal loss . DSC methods rely on decreased signal due to T2*-dephasing during passage of the gadolinium bolus. Extravascular gadolinium increases signal due to T1 effects and may blunt this desired T2* shortening. In some cases a paradoxical post-bolus signal overshoot may occur. Effect on steady-state signal . DSC image acquisition is typically performed using relatively short TR values (1000-2000 ms typical). Areas with T1 shortening due to accumulated gadolinium will recover more quickly between RF-pulses and thus have higher steady-state signals. This phenomenon increases with higher flip angles (  ). Several strategies exist to compensate for gadolinium extravasation. One popular method is to administer a gadolinium \"preload\" of approximately  to  of the total dose about 5-10 minutes before the regular injection and DSC sequence. The gadolinium preload raises the baseline signal in areas of contrast enhancement so that T2* changes during the DSC bolus can be better appreciated. A second method to reduce T1 effects from gadolinium leakage is to reduce the RF-flip angle of the DSC acquisition sequence. Reduction of flip angle can only be taken so far, however, as signal-to-noise will also decrease. Other methods to compensate for gadolinium accumulation include software-based leakage correction algorithms.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/t1-effects-on-dsc.html"}

Because there is no \"Unified Theory of Physics\", our knowledge of magnetism, like everything else, is incomplete. Angular momenta of electrons (and to a lesser extent, nuclei) impart some magnetic characteristics to all materials. Magnetism extends as a field far beyond the atomic level, however, and is intimately connected with electrical phenomena. Any current, moving charge, or changing electrical potential also generates a magnetic field. Magnetic flux lines radiating from a bar magnet. A piece of lodestone attracting bits of iron. To the ancients, magnetism was a recognized but mysterious force. Greeks living in Magnesia occasionally found rare and wonderful brownish-black rocks that had the power to attract objects made of iron. Known as lodestones , these were chunks of iron oxide (magnetite) that had probably been struck by lightning. Similar stones were discovered in Asia and by the 12th Century the Chinese used them to make compasses for navigation. Today even small children are familiar with the attraction and repulsion of hand-held permanent magnets, the modern successors to lodestones. Today we understand that the static magnetic fields associated with lodestones and permanent magnets derive principally from the total angular momentum of electrons within those materials. Lone electrons possess spin , a quantized fundamental property of nature denoted by the letter S . In addition to S , electrons orbiting a nucleus also possess orbital angular momentum (L) . Together S + L = J , or total angular momentum , is the property primarily responsible for bulk magnetism. Nuclei and other subatomic particles also possess spin angular momentum, but this effect is too weak to affect gross magnetic properties of a material. The relationship between electricity and magnetism was not appreciated until 1819 when Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted accidentally noticed the deflection of a compass on a nearby table while performing experiments with electrical currents in his laboratory. In 1826 Andr-Marie Ampre formally demonstrated the relationship between current and strength of the resultant magnetic field ( B ), whose direction is found by the right-hand rule . Ampre's Law and Fleming's Right Hand Rule. With the thumb pointing in the direction of current flow, one's fingers curl in the direction of B. The Faraday-Lenz principle of magnetic induction. A voltage (V) is generated in the coil proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field (dB/dt). The induced current opposes the applied field. Maxwell Equations. All results in classical electromagnetism can be derived from these four equations together with the Lorentz force law! Not only do electrical currents produce magnetic fields, but changing magnetic fields induce electrical currents . In 1831 Michael Faraday demonstrated the principle of magnetic induction by measuring the voltage ( V ) produced in a coil by a moving magnet. Three years later Heinrich Lenz showed that the current induced was so directed as to oppose the change in magnetic flux. The resultant Faraday-Lenz Law can be written V  ( dB/dt ) where dB/dt represents the rate change of the magnetic field. The negative sign reflects Lenz's principle that the induced current creates a \"counter field\" in a direction opposite to B . In the last half of the 19th Century a number of European physicists worked out further details of electromagnetic phenomena. Their names are legendary -- Carl Friedrich Gauss , Hendrik Antoon Lorentz , Joseph Henry , Heinrich Hertz , among others. James Clerk Maxwell made perhaps the most important contribution unifying magnetism, electricity, and light under a common wave-based electromagnetic theory. In the 20th Century Albert Einstein successfully recast the Maxwell equations into a relativistic framework. Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman and others subsequently integrated magnetism into quantum mechanics creating the new field of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) . In the 21st Century the boundaries of theory are being expanded to explain magnetic behavior on both very large (galaxy-size) and very small (sub-sub-atomic) levels. Still, no single model exists that explains all electromagnetic phenomena.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/what-causes-magnetism.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Sentinel Case (reported in AJNR 1986) Sentinel Case (California, 1985): A former sheet-metal worker was blinded from motion of an occult 2.0 x 3.5 mm intra-ocular metallic fragment during MR imaging at 0.35 T. Although the fragment had been seen on CT as well as on ophthalmologic examination, it was misdiagnosed as a post-inflammatory calcification, likely an old parasitic ( Toxicara ) granuloma. As the table was being moved out at the end of the completed MRI exam, the patient experienced a tugging sensation in his eye, a flash of light, then a dramatic decrease in vision. Examination revealed massive vitreous hemorrhage and retinal laceration. Patient with a BB in the orbit. No MRI for you! This justifiably infamous case shocked all of us working in the early days of clinical MRI. It stimulated everyone to adopt more rigorous standards for screening patients for orbital metallic foreign bodies. Either as a result of improved screening, or more likely in spite of it, there have been no cases of blindness and only four (4) additional reported metallic foreign body eye-related MR incidents since 1985 (details of each are summarized in the References below). This is against a background of over 500 million MRI scans being performed worldwide during the same period. Two of these reports described transient hyphemas (bleeding in the anterior chamber) that were cleared or resolving without treatment; one case described local eye pain (possibly heating related) that resolved immediately after removal from the scanner; the fourth report is of a patient had no immediate signs/symptoms, but later developed a cataract (which seems likely to have been the result of his initial injury, not the MRI). Because the risk of significant eye injury is extraordinarily low, we successfully adopted the strategy (based on the cost-effectiveness model of Seidenwurm) and used it without incident in over 500,000 cases during my tenure at Wake Forest. We ask the following during screening: Have you previously been struck in the eye by a piece of metal (such as shavings, shrapnel, or a BB)? If so, was it removed? In brief, we believe that mere occupational exposure to metal fragments is not sufficient to warrant additional radiographic workup. If there is reasonable suspicion that an orbital metal fragment is present, or if the patient seems unsure, then we investigate further, first reviewing any head CT, MR, or radiology studies obtained after the injury. It these do not exist or cannot easily be located, we then proceed with plain films of the orbits for screening. Although some have advocated the use of orbital CT for this purpose, experimental evidence in cadavers has shown that the threshold size of metallic particle detection using CT (~0.4 mm) is not remarkably superior to that of plain films (~0.5 mm). Furthermore, it is unlikely that particles  0.5 mm in size from industrial sources will penetrate the sclera or cause significant injury from MRI if they do.

From this raw data some potentially useful semiquantitative parameters can be extracted, such as time-to-peak (reflecting blood flow) and negative enhancement integral (reflecting blood volume). The first step toward gaining extracting more accurate and meaningful physiological information from this data is to convert signal intensity information into actual gadolinium concentrations. The conversion typically used is to assume that gadolinium concentration [Gd] is proportional to the observed change in T2*-relaxation rate (R2* = 1/T2*), which in turn is proportional to the negative logarithm of relative signal intensity: Here S o is the baseline signal intensity in a given voxel and S t is the signal at time t during passage of the gadolinium bolus.

The expanded acronym fairly completely describes what it entails: H alf-Fourier A cquisition S ingle-shot T urbo spin E cho imaging. Other vendors have similar sequences under slightly different names: GE (Single-shot fast spin echo, SS-FSE ), Philips (Single-shot turbo spin echo, SSH-TSE ; ultra-fast spin echo, UFSE ), HItachi (Single-shot fast SE), and Canon (Fast Advanced Spin Echo, FASE , SuperFASE). HASTE/SS-FSE is a single-shot technique . This means that data from all of k -space is obtained after a single 90-excitation pulse. This requires very long echo trains, which in modern scanners may number 128, 256, or even higher. By comparison, \"regular\" FSE/TSE is a multi-shot technique . This means that although k -space is traversed much more quickly than in conventional SE imaging, data from several separate RF-excitations are still needed to acquire all the data. For example, if 128 lines of k -space were to be sampled, a FSE/TSE sequence with an ETL/Turbo factor of 16 would require 128/16 = 8 \"shots\" to completely collect all the data. To minimize the number of lines sampled, HASTE/SS-FSE uses phase-conjugate symmetry (a partial Fourier method ) that takes advantage of certain \"mirror-image\" properties of k -space and the MR signal. This allows only a little more than half of k -space data to be directly collected, while the remaining lines can be estimated. A typical pulse sequence timing diagram for HASTE/SS-FSE is shown below: Representative HASTE/SS-FSE pulse sequence. Note asymmetric sampling in phase-encode direction.

The General Linear Model (GLM) can be daunting to those with little background in statistics or matrix algebra, but I'll try to make it more understandable here. This is a worthwhile endeavor, as GLM has been the most widely used technique for analyzing task-based fMRI experiments for the past 25 years and is the default method provided by vendors for their clinical fMRI packages. GLM can be thought of as an extension of a more familiar statistical technique: linear regression . Linear regression, sometimes called trend-line analysis , is a method used to calculate the \"best fitting\" line for a set of experimental data. Linear regression software is widely available in popular graphics and spreadsheet packages such as Microsoft Excel. Simplified linear regression example, adapted from data of Hansen et al (2004) As an application of linear regression, let us examine how the mean fMRI signal ( Y ) of a voxel in the visual cortex responds to increasing levels of retinal illumination ( X ). Plotting our data on a graph (left) we discern a fairly linear relationship between X and Y . Linear regression software computes the best fitting straight line for this data. For each data point ( x i , y i ) the relationship can be written y i = x i  +  i , where  is the calculated slope of the line and  i is the calculated error (or residual ) distance between the line and corresponding data point. Note that the x i values are determined by the design of the experiment, the y i values are measured, while  and the  i ' s are calculated by the software. A required assumption for linear regression is that the errors (  i ) are random and independent, following a Gaussian distribution with mean of zero. The best fitting line is defined to be the one that minimizes the sum of the squared errors (  1  +  2  +  3  + ) between the points and the chosen line. Note that although the calculated slope ( ) is the same for each data point ( x i , y i ), the individual errors (  i ) will differ. Our simple linear regression example has actually produced n separate equations, each of the form y i = x i  +  i , where n is the number of data points acquired for each time interval i . Matrix algebra allows us to condense this set of equations into a more manageable form. We do this by defining Y , X , and  as \"column vectors\", each containing a list of individual measured or calculated values. Specifically, If you are not familiar with matrix algebra or need a simple review, check out Coolmath.com The General Linear Model (GLM) representation of an fMRI experiment retains the same basic form ( Y = X  +  ) as does our simple linear regression example. Stated in words, the GLM says that Y (the measured fMRI signal from a single voxel as a function of time) can be expressed as the sum of one or more experimental design variables ( X ), each multiplied by a weighting factor (  ), plus random error (  ). In GLM both Y and  remain as single column vectors containing fMRI signal data ( y i ) or error estimates (  i ) respectively for a single voxel at successive time points ( i = 1 to n ). The experimental design matrix (X) , however, is typically much more complex, consisting of perhaps 5-10 columns instead of only one. Each new column of X would be constructed by the investigator to reflect a specific factor ( regressor ) thought to influence the outcome of the experiment. Essential regressors (also known as regressors of interest ) are a set of idealized predictions of what the hemodynamic response function (HRF) should look like if a voxel of interest became activated due to a task or stimulus. For example, consider a simple event-related fMRI experiment where a subject is given three tasks (A, B, and C)  such as listening to sounds at three different frequencies presented in random order. if the stimuli for Task A were applied at times denoted by the red arrows above, the predicted response of a receptive voxel in the auditory cortex might be a train of slightly-delayed, short-duration HRFs as illustrated. Numerical values ( X i,1 ) corresponding time points of this predicted response pattern to Task A would then be transferred to and listed vertically in the first column of the GLM design matrix (illustrated below). The predicted responses to tasks B and C would likewise be created and used to fill the second and third columns of the design matrix ( X ). The last 7 columns of our design matrix example are considered covariates or nuisance regressors  experimental factors that confound the analysis (such as head motion or signal drifts) but which are of no particular interest by themselves. The data filling these columns may be empirically determined (e.g., actual measurements of head translations and rotations obtained during the experiment) or modeled (e.g., by a linear trend or oscillating basis functions). Because the design matrix ( X ) now contains multiple columns, the weighting parameter (  ) will no longer be a single number as it was in the simple linear regression example. Fitting data in a full GLM experiment means that  will now become a column vector with values (  1 ,  2 , ,  p ), each reflecting the relative contribution of each design factor ( X i ) to the fMRI signal. Hence the amplitude vector (  ) must have the same number of rows as the design matrix ( X ) has columns. Depiction of the General Linear Model (GLM) for a voxel with time-series Y predicted by a design matrix X including 10 effects (three regressors of interest  e.g., tasks A,B,C  and seven nuisance regressors  e.g., six motion parameters and one linear drift). Calculated weighting factors (  1   10 ) corresponding to each regressor are placed in amplitude vector  while column vector  contains calculated error terms (  i ) for the model corresponding to each time point i . (From Monti, 2011, under CC BY license) Two major assumptions are inherent to basic GLM analysis, either one of which may be rightfully challenged. First, GLM is a univariate approach, calculating statistics on a voxel-by-voxel basis and assuming that signals from each voxel are independent of one another. Secondly, the model assumes that the errors are random and independent, following a Gaussian distribution with mean of zero. Statistical Parametic Map (SPM) overlaid on anatomic image With fMRI data collected and stored in the Y vector and experimental design factors specified in the X matrix, components of the  and  vectors are then computed using classical or Bayesian approaches. These results can then be statistically interrogated, testing various hypotheses about the regressors alone or in combination.

The sum of the eigenvalues (  1 + 2 +  3 ) is called the trace , while their average (= trace/3) is called the mean diffusivity or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) . Representation of the diffusion as an ellipsoid with three unit eigenvectors, (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ), with corresponding lengths (  1 ,  2 , and  3 ), the eigenvalues. Three diffusion tensor imaging techniques in common use are the fractional anisotropy map, the principal diffusion direction map, and fiber-tracking maps. Fractional Anisotropy Map Fractional anisotropy (FA) is an index for the amount of diffusion asymmetry within a voxel, defined in terms of its eigenvalues: Fractional Anisotropy map The value of FA varies between 0 and 1. For perfect isotropic diffusion,  1 =  2 =  3 , the diffusion ellipsoid is a sphere, and FA = 0. With progressive diffusion anisotropy, the eigenvalues become more unequal, the ellipsoid becomes more elongated, and the FA  1. The FA map is a gray-scale display of FA values across the image. Brighter areas are more anisotropic than darker areas. Principal Diffusion Direction Map This is a map that assigns colors to voxels based on a combination of anisotropy and direction. It is also called the colored fractional anisotropy map , fiber direction map or diffusion texture map. The color assignment is arbitrary, but the typical convention is to have the orientation of the principal eigenvector (  1 ) control hue and fractional anisotropy ( FA ) control brightness.

Gibbs artifacts (also known as truncation , ringing , or spectral leakage artifacts) typically appear as multiple fine parallel lines immediately adjacent to high-contrast interfaces. These artifacts are particularly problematic in spinal imaging, in which they may artifactually widen or narrow the cord or mimic a syrinx. Gibbs artifacts occur as a consequence of using Fourier transforms to reconstruct MR signals into images. In theory, any signal can be represented as an infinite summation of sine waves of different amplitudes, phases, and frequencies. In MR imaging, however, we are restricted to sampling a finite number of frequencies and must therefore approximate the image by using only a relatively few harmonics in its Fourier representation. The Fourier series, then, is cut short or truncated , hence the name for this artifact. Fourier composition of a square wave. (Courtesy of Dr. Dan Russell, Grad. Prog. Acoustics, Penn State). If the signal intensity of an object changes gradually in space, only a few Fourier terms are needed, and truncation errors are not evident. At high-contrast interfaces, however, truncation of the Fourier series results in significant artifacts, manifested by variable undershoot and overshoot oscillations. Depending upon the number of pixels spanning a high-contrast interface, truncation artifacts may have a variety of forms, including artifactual false widening of the edges at these interfaces, or edge enhancement of the interface and distortion of tissues immediately adjacent to the interface. For example, the high signal in the center and dark edges of the spinal cord (left) is another manifestation of the truncation artifact. Other examples of Gibbs (truncation) artifacts Because truncation artifacts arise as a fundamental consequence of the Fourier representation of an image, they occur in both the phase- and frequency-encode directions. However, because fewer samples are usually taken in the phase-encode direction (e.g., 128 or 192), the artifact is usually most prominent in the phase-encode direction. Truncation errors can be minimized by increasing the number of phase-encode steps or by reducing the field of view. They can never be entirely eliminated, however. A variety of methods operating on the data either at the k -space level or after processing are available for minimizing truncation artifacts. A straightforward technique used by nearly all vendors is to filter the k -space data with a smoothly decreasing (e.g. Hamming or Tukey) window prior to processing. Post-processing optimization techniques, such as the Total Variation (TV) method, may also be employed, but are more difficult to implement. All techniques are effective at reducing truncation artifacts, albeit at slight expense of image quality.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gibbs-artifact.html"}

The PROPELLER ( P eriodically R otated O verlapping Parall EL L ines with E nhanced R econstruction) technique was developed by Pipe in the late 1990s as a motion reduction method. The basic idea was to sample k -space in a rotating fashion using a set of radially directed strips or \"blades\". Each blade is composed of multiple parallel phase-encoded lines that can be collected using fast spin echo or gradient echo methods. In common practice, 8-32 blade lines are acquired in a single shot. The blades are then rotated by a small angle (1020) at which time a second set of data are acquired. The process continues until imaging data from the entire k -space circle has been collected. PROPELLER sequence sampling strips of data in a rotating fashion around the center of k- space The PROPELLER trajectory through k-space offers some unique advantages. The center of k -space (which contains the highest signal amplitude and contributes most to image contrast) is oversampled, meaning that the signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise will be high. Oversampling in this region also provides redundancy of information, meaning that the data for new each blade can be compared to the data from previous blades for consistency. If the patient moves between blades, the data for the second blade can be corrected (or even completely discarded) based on how anomalous its central information appears. The PROPELLER reconstruction algorithm involves several steps: 1) phase correction for each blade to assure its point of rotation is exactly at the center of k-space; 2) corrections for bulk in-plane rotation and in-plane translation of the object; and 3) correlation-weighting to minimize the data from blades containing motion or displacement errors. Current 2D versions of PROPELLER correct only for in-plane motion, but 3D versions may overcome this limitation in the future. This sophisticated reconstruction process does take some additional time after the scan is completed, and with our current computer hardware an additional delay of 15+ seconds may be required to process a large data set before the next sequence can begin. As with most popular MR sequences, all major vendors have their own minor variations with clever trade names: GE ( PROPELLER ), Siemens ( BLADE ), Philips ( MulitVane ), Hitachi ( RADAR ), and Canon ( JET ). The degree of motion correction can be substantial, and we routinely use PROPELLER sequences for DWI, FLAIR and T2-weighted images on any patient we suspect will not hold still during the course of a scan. Due to its oversampling of k -space, susceptibility artifacts are also slightly reduced.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Penile implants come in three basic types: (Diagrams from Zephyr Surgical Instruments) Soft penile implants are paired prostheses inserted into each corpus cavernosum. They are entirely made of silicone and thus \"MR Safe\". \"MR Conditional\" malleable penis implant Malleable penile implants are primarily made of silicone, but their distal portions usually contain a silver or stainless steel central core (for stability in bending and retaining shape). They are technically MR Conditional because of the metal, but in theory should be of no major concern for scanning. The only exception to this rule concerns two malleable implants produced by Dacomed in the 1980s and 1990s  the OmniPhase and DuraPhase  both with an appreciable amount of metal, including an adjustable-length tensioning cable connected by springs at each end mounted in metal housings. Although no adverse patient experiences have been reported, in vitro testing demonstrated appreciable magnetic deflection occurs at 1.5T. While the displacement force was not deemed medically dangerous (considering how these devices are used!), it is of sufficient magnitude that patient discomfort could potentially occur. The common wisdom has thus been to avoid MRI in patients with these two rare legacy implants unless medically necessary. Inflatable penile implants account for over 90% of currently implanted prostheses. They should perhaps better be called \"hydraulic\" implants, because the \"inflation\" is produced by manually pumping sterile saline from a reservoir into the cavernosal components. Nearly all of the commonly used implants (e.g., AMS 800, Coloplast Titan, Zephyr ZSI 475) contain small amounts of metal in the form of rear tip extenders, connectors, or springs within the scrotal pump valves. They are thus of no concern to scan as long as their specific MR Conditional rules are followed. .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/penile-implants.html"}

In fact most facilities have two types of \"Emergency Stop\" buttons with different actions. Emergency Shutdown: Does not quench the magnet but turns off most electrical power in the scanner room and operator area, including the console, computers, patient table, and anything on the UPS (uninterrupted power supply) circuitry. It may be a simple red button sometimes labeled with the confusing wording \"Emergency Stop\" or \"Power Off\". Emergency lighting is not affected and depending on system design and choices, there may be residual power to gradients and other devices in the equipment room. This switch should be used when there is a serious equipment fault or hazard, such as fire or water in the vicinity of the MR scanner. Emergency Magnet Rundown Unit (\"Quench Button\"): The EMRU initiates a controlled quench and turns off the magnetic field. The electrical power remains on. Like the Emergency Shutdown (\"Power Off\" switch) the EMRU is often a big red button located on the external wall of the magnet room near the door. It may be labelled \"Magnet Stop\" or \"Emergency Run Down\". This button should only be used in a life-threatening emergency, such as a patient pinned in the scanner by a metal object or a fire in the magnet gantry. Initiating an emergency quench is a serious proposition, placing the scanner out of service for a week or more, potentially damaging the magnet, and costing $30,000 or more to replace the lost liquid helium.

As described in the previous Q&A , non-fatty tissues contain three different pools of H nuclei involved in generation of the MR signal: 1) \"free\" water; 2) \"bound\" water; 3) macromolecules. \"Free\" water is largely unstructured except by transient hydrogen bonding to similar molecules. Its molecules rotate very rapidly, most of which are ineffective at producing relaxation. Both the T1 and T2 of \"free\" water are very long. Only a very narrow range of frequencies (<0-100 Hz) near the Larmor frequency can be used to excite this pool to resonance. The H nuclei in macromolecules , by contrast, have highly restricted motions. They are subjected to static and low frequency magnetic fields from neighboring nuclei and paramagnetic ions and have very short T2 values. The local magnetic fields experienced by these nuclei may vary by up to 1 mT (10 G), representing a range of resonant frequencies offset from the Larmor frequency at 1T in the range of  40 kHz. The T2 values of macromolecules are so short, in fact, that the direct signal from them decays so rapidly that they are not able to be directly recorded in routine MRI. Macromolecular H nuclei do have important indirect effects, however, and significantly modulate the signal from water protons. \"Bound\" water consists of a few layers of H 2 O molecules closely associated with the surface of macromolecules. Water in this \"hydration layer\" is moderately structured and has restricted motion because of hydrogen bonding with sites on macromolecules. Thus, like macromolecules it has very short T2 values and a broad range of resonant frequencies. \"Bound\" water may undergo both dipole-dipole cross-relaxation as well as chemical exchange with macromolecular H nuclei. \"Bound\" water also interfaces with \"free\" water on its outer surface, so it acts as a conduit for for the transfer of magnetization between the macromolecular and free water pools. Because of this close relationship, \"bound\" water and macromolecules together are sometimes referred to as the \" bound pool \" while \"free\" water is called simply the \" free pool \". In routine MRI a radiofrequency (RF) rotating magnetic field is applied at the Larmor (resonance) frequency with energy absorption primarily by free water protons. These excited H nuclei then begin a T1 relaxation process where they release this absorbed energy to the \"lattice\". In this case the \"lattice\" includes unexcited nuclei in all three pools  free water, bound water, and macromolecules. This energy transfer occurs through several previously described mechanisms, especially dipole-dipole and chemical exchange interactions. The shifting of energy between pools is known as magnetization transfer . Although we usually visualize the transfer of magnetization as free water  bound water  macromolecules, the process can proceed in the opposite direction. If we were to selectively deposit energy into the macromolecular pool (without affecting the water pool) using a specially designed RF pulse (called the MT Pulse ), the free water nuclei could serve as the final \"lattice\" or reservoir to disperse the injected energy. By stimulating the bound pool of protons, the Boltzmann distribution would be upset in favor of higher energy states. To return to equilibrium, this energy would need to be transferred to nearby unaffected spins, some of which are in the free water pool. These free water protons would be driven to higher energy states, partially saturating and hence reducing the net magnetization ( M free ) of the free water pool. If a second RF pulse were applied to the free water pool to generate an NMR signal, that signal would be smaller than it would have otherwise due to magnetization transfer of energy from the MT pulse. Magnetization transfer. An specially designed RF pulse (called an MT Pulse ) is applied which selectively injects energy into the bound pool of protons (macromolecules and bound water). This energy is then transferred (primarily by dipolar interactions) to the free water pool, partially saturating it. MT pulse is typically applied several hundred to several thousand Hz away from the water Larmor frequency (f o ) to saturate the macromolecular (bound) pool. In clinical MRI MT pulses are used prior to certain sequences to improve contrast especially in MR angiography. Although on-resonance multinomial pulses can be used, the common method of RF excitation is to apply an MT pulse with a bandwidth of a few hundred hertz and center frequency shifted from the water resonance by 1000 to 25,000 Hz. This is typically followed by gradient spoiling to avoid interference patterns with the next radiofrequency (RF) pulse. This off-resonance pulse has sufficient power to saturate protons in the immobile pool without directly affecting those in free water. Following this MT saturation pulse, a conventional MRA or other pulse sequence is performed.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/magnetization-transfer1.html"}

Why don't the spins flip 18 0  in some ot her direction, for example, below the transverse plane and to the left? Small technical points such as this frequently bewilder the beginning student but are seldom explained in textbooks on clinical MR imaging. Indeed, both types of 180 flipping are possible; which type of flip occurs in a given situation depends on the phase of the transmitted RF pulse. Recall that an \"RF pulse\" is merely a magnetic field ( B 1 ) of short duration rotating at the Larmor frequency in the transverse plane. Depending on its phase, B 1 may be considered to be \"directed\" along the x -axis or y- axis (or anywhere else in between). The above illustration shows the different refocusing directions produced by 180-pulses along different axes. By adjusting the phase of transmission, the 180 pulse may be applied along the x-axis, y-axis, or any other direction. On the left side of the diagram is a 180 y  pulse, that is, one that rotates the spins around the y-axis. The echo forms in the +y-direction. On the right is a 180 x  pulse that causes the echo to form along the y-direction. In the early SE experiments by Hahn (1950) and Carr and Purcell (1954), RF pulses were all applied along the same axis (usually x -direction). In practice, this method resulted in measured T2 values that were too short because of (1) cumulative phase errors from repetitive imperfect 180 pulses, and (2) B 1 inhomogeneity effects that spread the magnetization out in a plane containing B 1 and B o . In 1958 Meiboom and Gill proposed that such pulse-related errors could be reduced if the 180-pulses in a SE train were phase shifted 90 with respect to the initial 90 pulse. In other words, if the 90-pulse were applied along the x -axis, the 180-pulses would be applied alternately along the  y -axes. This technique, subsequently known by the acronym CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill), was extremely robust and is still employed on modern MR imagers when the SE technique is selected.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/direction-of-180deg-pulse.html"}

Parallel imaging techniques generally fall into two categories: 1) those were reconstruction takes place in the image domain requiring an unfolding or inversion procedure; and 2) those that take place in k -space, where calculation of missing harmonic data is performed prior to reconstruction. Hybrid techniques combining aspects of both techniques are becoming increasingly popular. Image domain PI is currently the most widely used method and perhaps the easiest to understand. We will refer to this technique under its original general acronym SENSE (SENSitivity Encoding) . Each major MR vendor offers some version of this technique under a different trade name: Siemens ( mSENSE ), GE ( ASSET ), Philips ( SENSE ), Hitachi ( RAPID ), Canon ( SPEEDER ). K -space PI techniques operate on signal data within the complex frequency domain before it has been transformed into an image. These methods, which we will group under their original acronym GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partial Parallel Acquisition) , are less widely used than SENSE and somewhat more difficult to understand. Siemens uses the term GRAPPA , GE calls their version ARC ( Autocalibrating Reconstruction for Cartesian imaging), and Canon EXSPER (not an acronym). To my knowledge the other major vendors do not yet offer k -space PI techniques as product. Relative Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Technique At the current evolving state of technology, no consensus exists as to which technique, if either, is universally superior. Whether to use an image domain method (SENSE/ASSET) or a k -space method (GRAPPA/ARC) may be both vendor- and case-specific. Nevertheless, the following general principles may apply. Total Imaging Time . GRAPPA/ARC is a somewhat longer sequence than SENSE/ASSET because it requires extra time for the self-calibration of k -space lines. This time penalty is more severe for low-resolution images where the calibration time occupies a larger percentage of total acquisition time. As the imaging matrix is increased in size, this relative disadvantage decreases. Signal-to-noise . SENSE/ASSET provides slightly higher SNR and better image quality as the acceleration factor is increased, but for R=2 the difference is negligible. Body Region . SENSE/ASSET does poorly in heterogenous body regions where accurate coil sensitivity maps may difficult to obtain (lungs); here GRAPPA/ARC may be preferred. Motion . SENSE/ASSET may do poorly if motion occurs between the calibration and acquisition scans, resulting in reconstruction artifacts. One obvious example is gross patient motion between sequences, even though the patient may hold perfectly still during the acquisition of each individual sequence separately. A second more subtle example applies to breath-hold liver imaging. Here, a patient may have difficulty suspending respiration to exactly the same degree between SENSE/ASSET calibration and imaging. Again, an autocalibrating technique like GRAPPA/ARC may be preferred (provided the entire sequence can be performed in the time of a single breathold). It should be noted that some newer SENSE variants (mSENSE, RAPID) use autocalibration, so this distinction disappears. Field-of-view (FOV) . GRAPPA/ARC is more tolerant toward small FOVs. SENSE/ASSET may produce aliasing/wraparound in the phase-encode direction if the full FOV is smaller than the imaged object. Conversely, GRAPPA/ARC allows a smaller FOV to be selected without significant artifact. Use in Single-Shot Echo-Planar Imaging . GRAPPA/ARC holds a definite advantage over SENSE/ASSET in that susceptibility-induced field distortions are less likely to affect the reconstruction process. Notwithstanding these subtle distinctions, SENSE and GRAPPA are largely interchangeable for nearly all applications.

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) , also known as arterial spin tagging , is an MRI method for measuring perfusion using the patient's own water molecules as tracers. Unlike Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) and Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) imaging, ASL does not require the injection of gadolinium or any other exogenous contrast material. The basic principle of ASL is illustrated below. First, \"control\" images are acquired through the area of interest (here the cerebral hemispheres). Next, \"tagging\" pulse(s) are applied to a slab of tissue proximally (upstream) from the imaging volume that inverts the magnetization of water molecules in this slab. Over the next couple of seconds, most of these \"magnetically labeled\" molecules lying within vessels will flow into the imaging volume. These tagged water molecules exchange their magnetization with those in the static tissue, reducing the latter's equilibrium magnetization slightly (by 1-2%). The area of interest is re-imaged, and data from the newly \"tagged\" images are subtracted from the \"control\" images on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The final subtracted image is thus perfusion-weighted . Generic ASL method showing basic principles of image contrast Unlike gadolinium contrast agents, water is a diffusible tracer. This means that tagged water molecules do not remain confined to the extravascular space but freely move from capillaries into tissue parenchyma including cells during the course of an ASL experiment. This has implications for mathematical modeling and estimation of perfusion quantitatively. In addition to measuring perfusion, ASL methods can be applied to generate images of blood vessels directly for MR angiography. ASL is also being used increasingly for to record areas of brain activation in fMRI as an alternative to BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) techniques. Several options are available for ASL labeling and imaging, and no single method has yet emerged as the undisputed best.

The electromagnetic spectrum used in NMR corresponds to \"radio waves\" used in commercial communications. MRI involves the absorption and emission of energy by nuclei at a specific resonant (Larmor) frequency . The Larmor frequency scales directly with main magnetic field strength ( B o ), and for clinical MRI lies in the range of tens to hundreds of MHz. These frequencies are part of the electromagnetic spectrum commonly used for radio transmission. For MRI a time-varying radiofrequency (RF) field, commonly referred to as B 1 , must be first transmitted into the spin system near the Larmor frequency. In addition to having specific frequency, the B 1 field must also be applied perpendicular to the main magnetic field ( B o ). The B 1 field is produced by driving electrical currents through specialized RF-transmit coils. These coils are located either within the inner walls of the scanner or as free-standing devices connected by cables placed on or near the patient. A sophisticated electronic \"RF-front end\" is responsible for generating, shaping, and amplifying the electrical currents required to produce the B 1 field. The basic components in this RF-transmit chain are: Frequency Synthesizer  Modulator  Amplifier  Quad Hybrid  T/R Switch  Coil Frequency synthesizer . This component produces a continuous sinusoidal carrier wave at (or near) the Larmor frequency. Driven by a quartz crystal, the synthesizer utilizes a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) monitored by a phase-locked loop (PLL) to maintain precise digital control over frequency and phase. The output from the synthesizer will be sent two places simultaneously: 1) further down the RF- transmitter chain to the pulse modulator for shaping; and 2) into the RF- receiver chain where it will be used as a reference for demodulating/decoding the MR signal. Pulse modulator . The B 1 fields used in nearly all clinical MR imaging applications are not transmitted as continuous waves, but in short (1-5 ms) bursts, called RF-pulses . The continuous carrier wave from the frequency synthesizer must therefore be \"chopped up\" into small pieces and these pieces appropriately \"shaped\" into pulses as dictated by the particular imaging application. The contours of each RF-pulse are specified using 100-200 data points, and are therefore of low-frequency (measured in kHz). The pulse-shape data is used to modulate the carrier wave so that the resultant output is a mixture of frequencies centered around the carrier. RF-pulse. The carrier frequency is modulated by a low frequency envelope, here a truncated sync = (sin x}/x function. High Power Amplifier. The newly fashioned RF-pulse next passes through a high-power amplifier that generates the large currents necessary to drive the RF-coils. The amplifiers used in modern MR systems typically produce peak power in the range of 10-30 kW resulting in maximum transmitted B 1 fields on the order of 10-50 T. The gain of the power amplifiers is adjusted by an active circuit element called the transmit attenuator . By changing the degree of RF attenuation (or alternatively, its gain/amplification) the flip angle of the RF pulse is adjusted. The terminology and measurement units differ by manufacturer , being variously referred to as transmit attenuation, transmit gain, RF gain, reference amplitude, RF level, or RF drive scale . Regardless of name, monitoring RF gain/attenuation is an important part of regular quality control to insure the scanner transmitter chain elements are working properly. Quadrature Hybrid Coupler . The output of the power amplifier is typically split into two equal parts by means of a quadrature hybrid coupler device. The resultant outputs are 90 out of phase with one another and are used to feed the two ports of the quadrature transmit coil. The two outputs of the coupler are commonly known as I and Q, standing for \"in phase\" and \"quadrature\" respectively. Transmit/Receive (T/R) Switch and Coil . The currents in the I and Q outputs of the coupler is now headed for the RF-transmitter coils. As scanners may have several possible transmitter coils, electronic switching circuitry is necessary to make sure that current is delivered to the proper coil at the proper time. Additionally, sometimes the same coils are used to both transmit B 1 and receive the MR signal. For these coils a special T/R switch is required to isolate the two functions and make sure the powerful electric currents used for transmission do not go into and burn up the sensitive receiver circuitry.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/radiofrequency-waves.html"}
{"id": "4eccf1b9-9d21-429c-ad81-fbc7210f9788", "contents": "MR Artifacts Why does the phase wrap-around artifact occur? Phase wrap-around is a commonly seen MR artifact that occurs whenever the dimensions of an object exceed the defined field-of-view (FOV). It is one particular manifestation of the aliasing phenomenon, described in the prior Q&A . Aliasing is the erroneous assignment of signal frequencies when the digital sampling rate is too low. The wrap-around artifact is generally easily recognized as a folding over of anatomic parts into the area of interest. Although this phenomenon may occur in the frequency-encode direction, it is generally more severe along the phase-encode axis. The physical basis for this phenomenon is illustrated below. Note that for each value of the phase-encoding gradient, a specific number of phase cycles is assigned to cover the field-of-view. In the first phase-encode step, for example, phase shifts of between 0 and 360 encompass the field-of-view. Parts of the object extending beyond the field-of-view possess phases less than 0 or greater than 360. Consider, for example, the subject's left flank in the drawing; it extends outside the field-of-view and encompasses phase shifts from 361 to 450. Since at this phase-encoding step all meaningful frequencies have been defined over the range of 0 to 360, a phase shift of 361 will be assigned to the spatial position of 1, and a shift of 450 will be assigned to 450-360 = 90. The left side of the patient's body will therefore be \"wrapped around\" and spatially mismapped to the opposite (right) side of the image. A similar process will wrap the patient's right side around to the left. Origin of the wrap-around artifact Phase wrap-around artifacts may also occur between end slices in 3D imaging. In 3DFT (volumetric) imaging, phase encoding is used to define the individual sections. If the imaged volume extends beyond the field of view in the slab-select direction, a phase wrap-around may occur between slices at the ends of the 3D partition. In the 3D head MRI study pictured right, scalp fat from the top of the head (the white oval) has wrapped around and is superimposed on tissues at the skull base.

That said, healthcare providers commonly prescribe and administer medications (many more toxic than gadolinium contrast) without obtaining this high level of consent. FDA-approved Medication Guide for Gadavist (gadobutrol). Click on image to enlarge. In 2017 the US Food and Drug Administration issued a Communication Warning requiring MR facilities to provide patients with a \" Medication Guide \", a 1-2 page summary of the potential risks of gadolinium contrast, including NSF, toxic effects of free gadolinium, and adverse reactions. Links to the FDA-approved Medication Guides approved for use in the USA can be found here . Searching for the text \"gado\" will bring up Guides for each of of the 8 FDA-approved agents. There is a slightly different Guide for each agent, though they are largely identical. While I don't agree with all the statements contained in these FDA Medication Guides (such as the weakly substantiated claims that gadolinium contrast produces \"pains, tiredness, skin, muscle, or bone ailments for a long time\"), that is something we in the USA will have to live with for now. Below is a suggested consent form for gadolinium contrast administration that may be used in conjunction with the FDA Medication Guide. Ultimately, the final decision concerning the need and type of informed consent will be based on national or state regulations, society guidelines, and institutional or departmental policies. SAMPLE CONSENT FORM FOR GADOLINIUM-BASED CONTRAST Your health care provider has determined that an MRI study with gadolinium contrast is needed to help diagnose your medical condition. Gadolinium contrast is given by injection into a vein and aids in distinguishing normal from abnormal tissues. The brand of gadolinium contrast you will receive (______________) has been determined to be safe and effective by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The attached Medication Guide has been approved by the FDA to help you understand some of the potential safety issues related to this drug. The MR technologist will review this Medication Guide with you and answer any questions you may have. As with any medication, a small chance exists that you may have a reaction to it. About 1 in 50 (2%) of patients will experience very minor and temporary side effects, including pain at the injection site, nausea, headache, dizziness, itching, rash, or hives. In about 1 in 5000 patients (0.05%), a true allergic reaction may occur (including facial swelling, difficulty breathing, or low blood pressure) requiring treatment. The odds of an extremely severe reaction is very rare  with the chance of death approximately 1:400,000 (0.00025%). Your odds of a reaction may be increased if you have had a previous allergic reaction to gadolinium, are allergic to other drugs or foods, have asthma, or suffer from kidney disease. Please inform the MR technologist if any of these situations apply to you. The use of gadolinium contrast is optional. However, your physician believes the potential diagnostic benefits for you exceed these small risks. By signing below you understand the statements above and agree to receive gadolinium contrast for your exam.

When ACR Group II agents are used (gadoterate, gadobenate, gadobutrol, gadoteridol) the risk to patients even with impaired renal function is close to zero, so the ACR does not recommend informing patients about this possibility. However, NSF is listed on each of the eight Medication Guides, so the patients will see it. I personally feel it should be addressed in all patients, if only to dismiss it as exceedingly rare.

The artifact is more commonly seen after left-sided injections due to the longer course of the left brachiocephalic vein. \"Pseudo-stenosis\" of the left subclavian artery (arrow) due to susceptibility (T2*) effects from residual gadolinium in the subclavian vein Venous contamination of carotid MRA from scanning slightly too late. Scanning Too Late: Venous Contamination Scanning too late allows time for venous return to occur, overlapping the arterial phase. This is particularly problematic in the intracranial and cervcial carotid systems where significant filling of the dural sinuses and jugular veins may occur within 5-10 seconds after arrival of the contrast bolus. The renal system is another place where rapid venous filling may be witnessed. Just like CTA, non-time-resolved CE-MRA offers only one chance to \"get it right\".

The reason for this appearance follows immediately from the fact that the center of k -space determines basic image contrast while the periphery provides high spatial frequencies and details. This \"too-early\" phenomenon was originally described by Maki et al. and is called the \"Maki\" of \"ringing\" artifact.

Isidor Rabi Isidor Rabi (1898-1988) Credit for the discovery of NMR goes to Isidor Isaac Rabi, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Working at New York Citys Columbia University in the 1930s, Rabi and his team were attempting to measure the magnetic properties of various nuclei including hydrogen, deuterium, and lithium. Using a modification of Otto Stern's apparatus, Rabi described how nuclei could be induced to flip their principal magnetic orientation by an oscillating magnetic field. This idea was originally proposed by Dutch physicist Cornelius J. Gorter in 1936 (one year before Rabi's successful demonstration), but Gorter was unable to validate this phenomenon due to limitations of his experimental setup. Gorter is sometimes known as \"the man who almost discovered NMR.\" Rabis method involved using an electromagnet of approximately 0.2T and a hairpin coil producing an oscillatory RF-field of about 3.5 MHz. The RF-field was maintained at constant frequency and the main magnetic field was varied by changing its current. Rabi then passed a \"molecular beam\" of lithium chloride (LiCl) molecules through a vacuum chamber and subsequently into the magnetic apparatus. In 1938 he and his team reported energy absorption/resonance peaks for both Li and Cl as predicted. Rabi named this phenomenon \"nuclear magnetic resonance.\" Resonance of LiCl from Rabi's 1938 paper. In honor of Dr. Rabi's achievements, The International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) presents the I.I. Rabi Award each year to a young investigator for contributions to the basic science aspects of NMR. Felix Bloch and Edward Purcell Felix Bloch (1905-1983) & Edward Purcell (1912-1997) Although Isidor Rabi is generally credited for the discovery of NMR, he did so in an inherently \"unnatural\" context  using a molecular beam in a vacuum where where individual nuclei were isolated from each another and their environment. It would not be until late 1945 that independent teams led by Felix Bloch at Stanford and Edward Mills Purcell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, would simultaneously demonstrate NMR in condensed matter (water and paraffin, respectively). Reports of their discoveries were simultaneously published as short \"Letters to the Editor\" in the January, 1946 issue of Physical Review . In recognition for this and their subsequent work, Bloch and Purcell jointly received the the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1952. In the late 1930's Edward Purcell was just beginning his career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and had only written a handful of papers prior to interruption of his research by World War II. Back at work in the winter of 1945, he, Henry Torrey, and Robert Pound filled an electromagnetic cavity with 850 cc of solid paraffin and placed the device in an electromagnet at Harvard's Research Laboratory of Physics. Driving the cavity with an oscillating current of about 30 MHz, the magnetic field strength was slowly increased until at about 0.7T when a sudden, 20-fold sharp increase in the cavity's absorption of radiation occurred, verifying the predicted nuclear magnetic resonance of hydrogen nuclei at that field strength and frequency. Diagram of resonant cavity used in Purcell's 1945 experiment for detecting resonant absorption of hydrogen nuclei in paraffin. Hairpin RF loops are shown; the main magnetic field is not pictured. About 1 month later at Stanford, Felix Bloch, William Hansen, and Martin Packard demonstrated NMR in a different substance and using a much smaller apparatus . They placed about 1 cc of water in a small glass bulb, around which were wrapped separate transmitter and receiver coils optimized for radiofrequencies in the range of 8 MHz. The receiver coils were placed perpendicular to the transmitter coils so that the input waves would not be detected. The RF-specimen device was then placed between the poles of an adjustable electromagnet operating at approximately 0.18T. Like Purcell's group, Bloch's team slowly changed the magnetic field until resonance was achieved. Rather than measuring absorption, however, Bloch et al. detected a nuclear induction signal in the receiver coil as a manifestation of the NMR phenomenon. Page from Bloch's notebook showing the theory behind his famous experiment. Note coffee stains. Bloch's apparatus. The water sample (hatched circle) is surrounded by transmitter and receiver loops. The main magnetic field (perpendicular to the plane) is not shown. I have always found it interesting that the two completely different experimental approaches used by Purcell and Bloch mirror the two different ways of describing the NMR phenomenon itself. Purcell's method, measuring energy absorption, is inherently quantum mechanical. Bloch's approach, recording a current induced in a nearby coil from rotation of a magnetization vector, is distinctly classical in nature. We continue to feel this dichotomy between the quantum and classical approaches even today. I strongly encourage everyone involved in the practice of NMR or MRI to take a few minutes to read some of the historical papers cited below. They are all very readable, even for those with little background in the field, and give insight into how such great advances took place.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/who-discovered-nmr.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Bone conduction hearing aids capture sound and transfer it via bone vibrations directly to the cochlea, thus bypassing the outer and middle ear. Surgically implanted, they are classified as either percutaneous or transcutaneous. Percutaneous bone conduction implants consist of a titanium post (screwed into the skull and protruding through the skin) to which a removable external sound processor is attached. Examples include the Oticon Pronto and Cochlear Baha Connect. Transcutaneous bone conduction implants do not have elements penetrating the skin. Passive transcutaneous implants like the Cochlear Baha Attract and Medtronic Alpha 2 MPO ePlus have an internal magnet bolted to the skull which receives vibrations from a removable external sound processor and magnet. Active transcutaneous devices, like the Med-El Bonebridge and Cochlear Osia, are similar to cochlear implants in that they have subcutaneously implanted electronic components, including a magnet, receiver coil, and stimulator. Signals are transferred electromagnetically across the skin from a removable external microphone, magnet, and sound processor. The final output from the internal device goes to a vibrating piezoelectric transducer attached to the skull. Pronto passive percutaneous bone conduction implant (Courtesy Oticon Medical, Inc.) Baha Attract passive transcutaneous bone conduction implant (Courtesy Cochlear, Inc) Bonebridge active transcutaneous bone implant with implanted transducer (Courtesy Med-El) Three major types of Bone Conduction Hearing Implants In general we would expect passive bone conduction implants to have an equal or better safety profile than cochelar implants because of their secure attachment to the skull. Of course, all external components must be removed prior to entering the scanner room. All commercially produced bone conduction implants are considered MR Conditional , which may impose some limits on field strength, spatial gradient, slew rate, switched gradient amplitude, SAR, and whether internal magnet removal is required. As always, the manufacturer's web site should be consulted for up-to-date product information and recommendations regarding scanning.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/bone-conduction-implants.html"}

The net magnetization ( M ) will precess around the direction of an applied magnetic field, but only after it has been tipped out of its initial equilibrium alignment with the field by another field or force. This process is illustrated below: In the first image we see the definition of net magnetization (M) , the vector sum of of spin angular momentum obtained from millions of individual nuclei. Although the individual nuclei are all precessing, at this time M is not. This idea is reinforced in the second image where M 's angular momentum is shown to be aligned with the external field ( B o ). Just like a perfectly upright spinning top or gyroscope, there is not yet a precession of M. To induce precession, M must be displaced out of its equilibrium alignment by an external injection of energy. Typically this is from a second magnetic field (denoted B 1 ) rotating/oscillating at the Larmor frequency. Once tipped out of alignment, M will precess in the transverse plane also at the Larmor frequency. Precession of M at the Larmor frequency around the direction of Bo In reality B 1 is interacting with the millions of individual spins that comprise M rather than M itself. However, it is useful to consider all the spins added together into a single entity ( M ) because we may treat it as a regular vector using simplified principles of classical physics. This onset of M 's precession coincides with the start of an oscillating energy exchange between B 1 , the spins, and their environments. Thus, when M begins to precess, nuclear magnetic resonance is occurring.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/does-m-also-precess.html"}

The B1 RF-field is perpendicular to Bo RF-coils may serve as transmitters, receivers, or both. When used as transmitters , RF-coils generate an oscillating/rotating magnetic field (denoted B 1 ) that is perpendicular to the static main magnetic field ( B o ). If the oscillation of B 1 closely matches the natural precession of nuclear spins near the Larmor frequency, energy is deposited into the spin system causing a change in its net alignment. The B 1 field is generated by the transmit RF-coil in response to a powerful current generated by the scanner's transmit circuitry. B 1 is typically turned on for only brief periods of time (a few msec), called  RF-pulses . By adjusting the magnitude or duration of these B 1 pulses, the nuclear spin system can be rotated by variable flip angles, such as 90 or 180. When used as receivers , RF-coils are responsible for detecting the MR signal. The oscillating net magnetic flux from the excited spin system can be captured by the coil in which an induced electric current is generated. This current is then amplified, digitized, and filtered to extract frequency and phase information. Today RF receive-only coils are often collected into large arrays for use in parallel imaging applications. Although RF-coils serving both transmit and receive functions were once the norm, todays modern scanners mostly utilize separate transmit and receive systems. However, some special parts transmit-receive RF-coils are still in common use, especially those used for head and knee imaging. The physics and design of each of these coil types is different and will be flushed out in more detail in subsequent Q&As. Large arrays of receive only surface coils are possible with parallel imaging. (Courtesy Canon) Transmit-receive head coil", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/rf-coil-functions.html"}
{"id": "762f6ece-019b-4327-a323-f05051cec4c7", "contents": "Spin Echo Variations What is the difference between spin echo, multi-spin echo, and fast spin echo? Single Echo Spin Echo The simplest form of the spin-echo (SE) pulse sequence consists of 90-pulse, a 180-pulse, and then an echo. The time between the middle of the first RF pulse and the peak of the spin echo is called the echo time (TE) . The sequence then repeats at time TR , the repetition time . Conventional (single echo) SE pulse sequence As described in a previous Q&A , the 180-pulse allows refocusing of nonmoving spins whose phases have been scattered by constant field distortions and inhomogeneities. The pulse does not correct for T1 or true T2 effects due to random processes at the atomic/molecular level. It does not correct for phase shifts of spins that move, flow, diffuse or undergo chemical exchange. But if the spin has dephased simply because it is sitting near a chunk of iron-containing hemosiderin or near some imperfection in the main magnetic field of any cause, the 180-pulse will correct for that! Formation of the SE. Click image for animation. The animation to the left (borrowed from Wikipedia ) shows the steps of SE formation: 1) tipping of spins into the transverse plane by the 90-pulse; 2) dephasing of these spins by local magnetic field inhomogeneities; 3) flipping of the entire ensemble like a pancake in the transverse plane by the 180-pulse; and 4) refocusing of spins into a SE at time TE = 2 x t . Multi-echo Spin Echo As long as T2-relaxation has not completely destroyed the MR signal, it is possible to stimulate the system with additional 180-pulse(s) and generate additional echo(es). The amplitude of each echo is progressively smaller due to T2 decay. A double-echo SE sequence Until the last decade double-echo SE sequences like the one pictured above were a standard technique. The first echo (at short TE ) provided \"spin-density\" contrast while the second echo (at long TE ) provided T2-weighted contrast. Today, T2-FLAIR has largely supplanted spin-density-weighted SE images for most applications, so multi-echo SE is only occasionally used. Fast (Turbo) Spin Echo (FSE) Multi-echo SE should be distinguished from FSE where multiple 180-pulses and echoes also follow each 90-pulse. The simplified FSE pulse-echo timing diagram appears below Fast (turbo) SE diagram Superficially this appears similar to multi-echo SE, although you may note that the echoes are not uniformly diminishing in size with increasing TE multi-echo SE as expected. The reason the echoes look different is because in FSE different phase-encoding gradients (not shown) are being applied with each 180-pulse. In single echo and multi-echo SE imaging, the phase-encoding gradient is turned on only once in each TR interval. Depending on the number of echoes, in FSE imaging the phase-encoding may be applied 8, 16, 32 or more times in each TR interval.

Caipirinha is Brazil's national cocktail, made from sugar cane liqueur (cachaa), sugar, ice, and lime. It received increased world-wide recognition as the result of news coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In MRI, however, CAIPIRINHA is a parallel imaging technique offered by Siemens and used primarily for 3D breath-hold abdominal imaging. The acronym stands for Controlled Aliasing in Parallel Imaging Results in Higher Acceleration . Both SENSE and GRAPPA can be performed in 3D acquisition mode using acceleration in two phase-encoding directions simultaneously. Due to variability in coil geometries and sensitivities, however, severe residual aliasing artifacts and amplified noise may occur when high R-values are chosen. CAIPIRINHA uses a group unique k -space sampling patterns to reduce pixel aliasing and overlap on reconstructed images. Acquired points in k -space are shifted from one another by applying additional offsets to the phase-encoding gradient tables. Below are three possible k -space filling patterns for a GRAPPA-like parallel imaging sequence with R=4. Note that the readout direction ( k x ) is directed into the page. The red circles represent acquired data points; the white circles represent missing data points that must be estimated from the known (red) points during reconstruction. Acceleration in a single direction (R=4) Acceleration in two directions (R = 2 x 2 = 4) CAIPIRINHA pattern with acceleration in two directions plus phase shift of alternate rows In the first diagram acceleration has been performed along a single direction ( k z ) with every 4th line of data acquired. This strategy often leads to increased noise and residual aliasing artifacts. In the second diagram a better strategy has been adopted with the acceleration evenly split between the k y and k z directions. Every other line of data has thus been skipped in each of the two phase-encode directions. The total acceleration remains at 4 (R = 2 x 2). The third diagram shows a CAIPIRINHA pattern of sampling with R=2 in each phase-encode direction plus a phase shift of data sampling in the middle column (and every 4th column thereafter). In other words, the k -space sampling pattern can be viewed as staggered or sheared . This phase offset improves the accuracy of reconstruction while reducing noise and aliasing. Aliasing artifacts are still present but they are shifted to the corners of image space and are less likely to become concentrated in a few locations. At present one of the most common uses of CAIPIRINHA is for liver studies where highly accelerated, excellent quality images can be obtained during passage of contrast. A clinical example is shown below. Other uses of CAIPIRINHA include diffusion-weighted imaging and MRA. 3D T1-VIBE using CAIPIRINHA with acceleration factor (R) = 4 A set of 72 slices (3-mm-thick) through the entire liver are repeatedly acquired every 2 sec in a single breath hold during dynamic passage of contrast. CAIPIRINHA may be operated in multislice mode ( MS-CAIPIRINHA ), 2D-mode ( 2D-CAIPIRINHA ), or in a 3D pattern that takes advantage of coil sensitivity profiles along the readout direction ( Wave-CAIPI ). (Note that most other 3D PI techniques only exploit coil sensitivity v ariations along the phase-encoding and partition-encoding axes and ignore variations along the readout-axis.) As such, Wave-CAIPI can boast acceleration factors in the range of 9-12 with low artifacts and negligible g-factor penalties, finding great utility in high-resolution volumetric imaging.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/caipirinha.html"}

The choice of flip angle is critical for determining both signal intensity as well as image contrast. It also depends on the particular pulse sequence utilized. For the purposes of this question we will restate it slightly: Which flip angle gives the maximum signal for a given tissue? We will further restrict our answer to a particular class of commonly used GRE sequences where transverse coherences (discussed in a later Q&A ) are purposely disrupted. These are known as \"Spoiled-GRE\" sequences and include many with familiar names (FLASH, SPGR, VIBE, T1-FFE, MPGR, MP-RAGE). For now don't worry what spoiling means, as we will cover that in another Q&A very shortly. The important result is that for such sequences in which no transverse coherences exist, MR signal is maximized at the Ernst angle ( E ) , which can be calculated from the equation  E = arccos ( e TR/T1 ) Note that this equation predicts that the optimal flip angle will be 90 only when TR>>T1. As an example, let us calculate the optimal flip angle for such a sequence in the brain (where the average T1 = 800 msec). When TR = 3000, the Ernst angle is computed to be 89. In this situation, a conventional 90 pulse is nearly optimal. When TR = 100 msec, however, a different result is obtained. Here the optimal angle is calculated to be only 28. Although the Ernst angle may provide maximum signal intensity on a spoiled-GRE sequence for a single tissue, it does not necessarily maximize the contrast between two different tissues. In the graph left it can be seen that the maximum contrast between tissues A and B is obtained at a flip angle far away from the Ernst angle for either individual tissue.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/optimal-flip-angle.html"}

The partial volume effect/artifact is a concept so well recognized in cross-sectional imaging that it borders on being too simplistic to include in this Q&A website. At the same time, however, it is so important that I have chosen to provide a brief explanation and example for the benefit of non-radiologists who may be reviewing topics here. The idea is easily appreciated in the example below. Here the red and yellow circles represent nerves and scar tissue residing in cerebrospinal fluid (blue). Their respective MR images appear below. The left diagram and image are 5-mm thick; the right diagram and image are 1-mm thick. The 5-mm thick voxels are of lower resolution reflecting signals that are a mixture of nerves/scar and CSF. The thin sections on the right have much less admixing of signals; the individual tissues are now sharply defined. Partial volume averaging. In 5-mm-thick section (left) delicate nerves and scar in the subarachnoid space cannot be resolved as their signals are mixed/averaged with CSF and other tissues. Thin-section (1-mm-thick) image (right) displays the detailed anatomy to good advantage. In mathematical terms, consider a voxel that contains fractional amounts f A and f B of two materials, A and B. The MR signal from the entire voxel ( S V ) will then reflect the weighted average of signals S A and S B from the two components S V = f A S A + f B S B Imperfect RF-pulse profiles may also cause to partial volume effects by exciting tissues outside the desired slice. When multiple slices are placed side, this interference is known as cross-talk . The main strategy for decreasing partial volume artifacts is to use smaller, more sharply-defined voxels. This means thinner sections, smaller fields-of-view, and/or higher imaging matrix sizes. Using longer duration RF-pulses (or at least avoiding \"fast-RF\" pulse options) will improve slice profiles and create more precisely defined voxels with less excitation of adjacent tissues.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/partial-volume-effects.html"}

This is a common problem that comes up several times a month at our institution. The most common locations are the transverse sinuses, jugular, femoral, and iliac veins. Fortunately, there are usually clues on routine imaging sequences, as well as special techniques that may help you resolve this dilemma. Pseudothrombosis in left transverse sinus due to sluggish flow 3D-TRICKS gadolinium-enhanced MR venogram confirms that the sinus is patent The \"thrombus vs slow flow\" problem can usually be solved by non-MRI methods, such as CT venography or Doppler ultrasonography. Or the patient could be scheduled to return to the MR center for phase-contrast or gadolinium-enhanced venography, as shown in the example above. If the patient is still in the scanner when the thrombosis question is raised, an argument might be made simply to perform a (usually) definitive contrast-enhanced MR venogram at the time. This may not be possible, however, for the following reasons: 1) the patient may have already received gadolinium; 2) gadolinium may be contraindicated because of allergy or renal insufficiency; and 3) insurance may not cover the additional study. Often, however, the question of slow flow vs thrombosis arises after the study has been completed and the patient has left the MR Center. Of course, the patient could be called back for additional sequences, but why subject the patient to the extra time and expense of this when in most cases you can solve the problem by careful inspection of the images you have? Clues on Routine Imaging The first step in differentiating between slow flow and thrombus is to look carefully at the area in question on all imaging sequences. It is particularly helpful if the same pulse sequence has been used in two different planes. With slow flow, the intravascular signal often changes when different imaging planes have been used; thrombus will have the same intensity regardless of the plane. A second clue from routine imaging is to compare the signal of the questionable vessel on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Flow enhancement usually fades as TE is increased; thrombus is often of intermediate or high signal on all sequences. (If gradient-moment nulling was used on the long TE image, however, this trick will not work.) If diffusion-weighted imaging or T2*/susceptibility-weighted imaging has been performed, these images may provide powerful information about the presence or absence of thrombosis. Generally, acute or subacute thrombus will be bright on DWI and dark on T2*/SWI images. Longstanding clot may not have these identifiable signal characteristics, however. Is the abnormal intravascular signal maximal at the end slice, and does it fade out as one moves inward? Chances are you are dealing with inflow enhancement rather than thrombus. Is there any evidence of phase artifacts (ghosting) adjacent to the vessel? (You may have to re-window the image and look in the air outside the patient to see it). If you do see ghosting, some flow must be present. Does the area in question get brighter with gadolinium? Although gadolinium may diffuse into a clot, seeing a significantly brighter signal postcontrast supports the diagnosis of vascular patency. However, since tumor thrombi may enhance vividly with gadolinium, contrast enhancement will not aid much in the differential diagnosis in this scenario. If the patient is still in the scanner at the time the questionable venous abnormality is noted a quick 2D phase-contrast MR venogram may be with a low velocity-encoding (VENC) gradient (e.g., 20 cm/sec). Slow flow will often become immediately apparent when this technique is used. Very slow flow may still be missed, however. Another simple technique is to apply a presaturation band upstream from the site of suspected thrombosis. The signal from thrombus will be unaffected by this maneuver; flow signal will be reduced or eliminated. Try repeating the T1- or T2-weighted images using a different plane of section than in the original. Slow flow may change its appearance, but thrombus will not. Finally, consider repeating the sequences with and without gradient-moment nulling. Flow may change in appearance, thrombus will not. If these techniques all fail, you may need to equivocate and recommend an additional MR, CT, or Doppler study to resolve the issue. With careful observations and employing the techniques above, this should only occasionally be necessary.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/slow-flow-v-thrombus.html"}
{"id": "028ebb86-7ee7-4ed7-b797-df28b1bcc071", "contents": "BOLD Contrast Mechanism How is image contrast produced by BOLD fMRI? BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast results from changing regional blood concentrations of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. As described in a prior Q&A , oxyhemoglobin has no unpaired electrons and is weakly diamagnetic . When oxygen is released to form deoxyhemoglobin , 4 unpaired electrons are exposed at each iron center, causing the molecule to become strongly paramagnetic . The BOLD effect is directly related to the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin, which varies from less than 2% in arterial blood to greater than 40% in venous blood. Deoxyhemoglobin is strongly paramagnetic due to 4 unpaired electrons at each iron center. The regional T2 and T2* relaxation times of brain decrease as the fraction of deoxyhemoglobin increases. The ultimate effect on the MR signal depends on field strength ( B o ), pulse sequence (SE or GRE), and echo time ( TE ) selected. Regardless of technique, brain areas with more oxyhemoglobin will have higher signal (and appear brighter) than those containing deoxyhemoglobin. Paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin (D) confined to red blood cells causes a local field distortion in and around the vessel.  The presence of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin within red blood cells creates local magnetic field distortions (susceptibility gradients) in and around blood vessels. These local field disturbances cause nearby stationary and slowly moving spins to have different resonance frequencies and phase shifts. The resultant intravoxel dephasing is a classic T2*-shortening effect most prominent near larger veins and accentuated by use of GRE sequences with echo times ( TEs ) close to T2*. The effect scales linearly with field strength ( B o ) and is the dominant mechanism for BOLD contrast at 1.5T. Local field disturbances produced by intravascular deoxyhemoglobin also affect protons in water molecules diffusing in and around these vessels. Such protons experience randomly changing frequency offsets and undergo unrecoverable dephasing. This diffusion-related T2-signal loss is best appreciated using spin echo techniques (that reverse phase losses secondary to static field inhomogeneity effects) and is more prominent adjacent to capillaries (than near larger vessels). True-T2 diffusion effects scale with the square of magnetic field strength ( B o  ) and consitute the dominant mechanism for BOLD contrast at 4.0T and higher. (At 3.0T, where most clinical fMRI studies take place, the T2 and T2* effects make comparable contributions to BOLD contrast.)", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/bold-contrast.html"}

Cardiac MRI exams are among the most difficult of all MR studies to perform well. They require not only a top-notch team of experienced physicians, technologists, and nurses, but cooperation of the patient to obtain the highest quality images. Patients need to understand the importance of holding their bodies still during the examination, a challenging task in that many CMR exams take more than an hour to complete. They must be coached at being consistent in their breath-holding patterns and given practice with suspended respiration before being placed in the scanner. For most patients holding their breaths in expiration (\"breathe in...breathe out...hold it\") will lead to a more consistent position of the diaphragm and is the preferred method. A minority of patients may find this difficult or uncomfortable and suspension in inspiration will therefore need to be used. In addition to routine safety screening and questioning about allergies, several additional preparations are required if a dynamic, gadolinium-enhanced stress perfusion MRI is to be performed: Renal function testing . Because of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, gadolinium cannot be given safely to patients with severe renal disease and should be administered in reduced dosage for patients with renal insufficiency. If there is any suspicion of renal disease a recent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should generally be obtained by serum blood test prior to gadolinium administration. Cardiac troponin testing . Cardiac troponins are enzymes released by damaged myocardium. As pharmacological stress testing is generally contraindicated after a recent myocardial infarction, measurement of serum troponins should be performed in the appropriate clinical setting. Medical history review . In addition to recent myocardial infarction, pharmacological stress testing may be contraindicated in patients with acute myocarditis/pericarditis, progressive unstable angina, rapid arrhythmias, 2nd or 3rd degree AV block, and other disorders. Questioning the patient about reactive airway disease should always be performed, as regadenoson (Lexiscan) would likely be preferred over adenosine in this clinical scenario. Informed consent . Pharmacological stress testing confers additional rare but significant risks to the patient, including myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, seizures, stroke, and even death. Hence a formal signed consent and discussion with the patient is required. Start 2 IVs . Gadolinium and adenosine cannot be given through the same line, so two separate IVs are required. Separate lines are optional if regadenoson or dobutamine are used. Avoidance of stimulants . Patients should be advised not to consume stimulants such as coffee, tea, caffeinated sodas, energy drinks, and chocolate within 12-24 hours of the scan. These can interfere with the efficacy of the pharmacological stress testing and interpretation of the examination. Finally, establishing a good EKG tracing is essential for obtaining high quality CMR images. Techniques for achieving this are described in the next two Q&A's.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding The American College of Radiology (ACR) has defined four safety zones (labeled I - IV) in and around a magnetic resonance imaging facility. All patients and non-MR personnel entering Zone III must undergo screening for implants and foreign bodies that may put them at risk in the magnetic environment. The recently published ACR Manual on MR Safety provides numerous excellent guidelines and suggestions for screening subjects. At least two separate screenings should be performed for non-emergent patients. The first level of screening should take place when the examination is ordered. The MR employee scheduling the exam should have basic training in MR safety and have ready a brief set of screening questions for the referring health care provider ordering the study. At a minimum, these questions should include: a) whether the patient has any implanted cardiac devices (pacemakers, wires, defibrillators) or other active devices (cochlear implant, neurostimulators, infusion pumps); b) a cerebral aneurysm clip; and c) any known metal fragments in critical locations like the eye. Alternatively, if the examination is ordered through the electronic medical record, these questions can be programmed in with hard stops requiring an answer before allowing final scheduling. Although these questions are not exhaustive, they do cover a large fraction of common implants that potentially could create risk for the patient. The second level of screening takes place when the patient presents to the MR Center for their exam. Conscious, non-emergent patients should complete a detailed written screening form like that pictured below. For children or patients with altered levels consciousness, history obtained from a source (parent, spouse, guardian) deemed reliable is acceptable. A technologist or other safety-trained staff member should then review the form in detail, with both parties signing it. For patients with altered consciousness for whom no reliable medical history is available, we review all recent imaging studies available, supplemented by plain film x-rays of the head and neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis as needed. Sample MR Safety Screening Form provided by the ACR. Click on image to download the entire form as a pdf. If a family member or other caretaker wishes to accompany the patient into Zone III and IV, they must undergo the same complete screening as the patient. The above discussion applies to patient screening for devices and foreign bodies inside the body. Of course, a wide range of potentially dangerous objects (which might cause burns or act as projectiles) may be on the surface of the patient's body or in their clothes. We therefore recommend all patients change into MR-safe gowns, remove all jewelry, watches, hearing aids, piercings, hair pins, metallic drug delivery patches, and eye makeup before entering Zone III. Final screening by a ferromagnetic metal detector is recommended by the ACR, but this should not replace fastidious personal evaluation by the technologist.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mr-safety-screening.html"}
{"id": "502af989-339b-41c8-a96f-09792d0be1a8", "contents": "Implant Heating: Physics Can gradients cause implant heating like RF-pulses? As described several prior Q&As ( [1] , [2] ) energy deposited in tissues during MRI produces heating. Changing magnetic fields (from both RF- and imaging gradients) generate electric (eddy) currents in accordance with Faraday's law of induction. When these currents encounter electrical resistance, thermal energy is produced. The degree of energy transfer can be quantified by the specific absorption rate (SAR) , measured in units of power per mass of tissue (W/kg). When a metallic implant is present, energy may be deposited both within the implant itself as well as in the immediately adjacent tissues. The latter effect may be intensified by scattered radiation at the surface of the implant. What happens precisely depends on the shape and composition of the implant and whether we are dealing with RF- or switched gradient-sources. Differences Between RF- and Gradient-Induced Heating Both RF and gradient fields produce tissue heating, but the effects are different because of the geometry, magnitude, and frequency characteristics of each. In typical MRI applications, RF-fields are designed to be relatively uniform over the entire volume of the transmit coil; they have maximum amplitudes on the order of 10T and frequencies in the 100 MHz range. Time-varying gradient fields for spatial encoding are designed to have amplitudes near zero at isocenter, increasing to the range of 10mT near the ends of the scanner bore; their base frequencies lie in the range of 1-2 kHz with harmonics extending to over 10 kHz. RF-related heating is the dominant cause of peri-implant heating. The currents induced by RF-irradiation do not penetrate to the center of the metallic implant but reside almost entirely along its surface; this phenomenon is known as the skin effect (explained more completely in the Popovi r eference below). RF-induced currents thus flow through only a tiny fraction of the total implant mass at its surface and do not cause direct heating of the implant. In the soft tissues immediately adjacent to the implant, however, electric fields and currents become concentrated and very high levels of heating may occur. One special example of localized RF-heating around an implant is known as the \" antenna effect \" , seen in elongated implants like wires or electrode leads whose lengths are between  and  the RF-wavelength. In this scenario electrical fields can become augmented at the tip of the device, leading to heating and the possibility of internal burns. SAR \"hot-spot\" due to antenna effect at the tip of a deep brain stimulator. (From Iacono et al under CC BY) Gradient-related heating is entirely different, depositing energy within the implant itself that only indirectly heats surrounding tissues. Because gradient switching frequencies are 100,000 times lower than RF frequencies, induced electrical currents are not confined to the \"skin\" of the implant, but circulate throughout it. Heating may occur in implants with large cross sections having low-resistance closed current loops (such as hip prostheses, pulse generators, and infusion pumps). Gradients do not generate appreciable eddy currents in tissues, so any adverse thermal effects are due to heat diffusion from the implant itself. Numerical simulations of gradient coil (GC) and radiofrequency (RF) heating in adult with a unilateral hip prosthesis. Gradient heating is confined to the immediate vicinity of the implant and greatest in extended cross-sections (here the acetabular cup). RF heating can create hotspots throughout the body. RF heating near the implant is most prominent at pointed elements (tip of femoral stem and screw in the superior acetabulum). (From Winter et al under CC BY) The major differences between gradient-induced and RF heating are summarized below", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/gradient-vs-rf-heating.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding In the late 2000s several medical device companies began to develop cardiac pacemakers that were MR Conditional. The first to market was Medtronic's EnRhythm  MRI SureScan Pacemaker System (which received CE Mark approval in November 2008). The device was modified and rebranded as RevoMRI  SureScan System, receiving FDA approval in February. 2011. Multiple components of the classic pacemaker system had be re-engineered to allow the devices to be MR Conditional . The most important changes included the use of Hall-effect sensors instead of reed switches to toggle pacing mode, software reprogramming for operation in \"MRI mode\", and innovative lead design to minimize heat generation and standing wave currents. These and other modifications are illustrated below. How various pacemaker components have been re-engineered to make them MR Conditional. (From Po et al under CC-BY) Today, at least a half-dozen companies manufacture MR Conditional pacemakers and ICD's which are becoming widely implanted. Being MR Conditional means they are reasonably safe to scan provided specific conditions are followed. Such conditions will vary by the particular device and manufacturer. These conditions are generally quite extensive and must be followed precisely. As always, check with the manufacturer's web site for the most current requirements. Below are some generic conditions that typically accompany MR Conditional Cardiovascular Implanted Electronic Devices (CIEDs) : Need/risk assessment . Does the patient really need an MRI? A r adiologist may need to be consulted to determine whether an alternative (non-MRI) exam may provide equal or superior diagnostic results. If a need is demonstrated, a cardiologist should determine whether or not the patient is pacemaker-dependent (as some different conditions and risks may apply). Device identification . T he exact model of Pacemaker/ICD, leads used, and date of placement must be established with certainty. Most manufacturers recommend waiting 6 weeks to allow for maturation of the lead-myocardial interface prior to MRI. Leads must also be MR Conditional and appropriately paired with the proper the pulse generator component. (Note that an MR conditional lead from one company coupled with an MR conditional pulse generator from a different company renders the entire device Non-conditional). Obtain or review a recent chest x-ray . This will confirm several important requirements: a) that the pulse generator is implanted in the left or right pectoral region (anywhere else is contraindicated); b) that there are no lead extenders or adaptors; c) that no abandoned or broken leads are present; and d) there are no additional nearby electronic implants such as neural stimulators. Evaluation and interrogation of the CIED . A cardiologist or skilled electrophysiology technologist should remotely interrogate the device to be insure the battery is not near the end of its life and that lead impedances and capture threshold values lie within specified ranges. (For ICDs, defibrillation lead impedances should also be checked). It should also be documented that no diaphragmatic pacing is noted at the highest lead voltages. MR Equipment and Protocols . All current MR-conditional pacemakers are restricted to H imaging in horizontal bore cylindrical magnets operating at 1.5 or 3.0T. Usually only the supine or prone patient positions are allowed. Limits for maximum spatial gradient, gradient slew rate, and RF power dissipation measured by average SAR or maximum B 1+RMS must be followed. Limitations may be more stringent if the thorax is imaged, including restrictions on the use of local transmit/receive coils and parallel RF transmission. CIED set to operate in appropriate pacing mode for MRI . The proper pacing mode should be determined by the cardiac electrophysiology service. Most MR-conditional CIED's have an \"MRI Mode\" with a stepwise algorithm allowing the best parameters to be selected. (Note that this is not the same as \"magnet mode\" which sets resets the CIED to a device-specific pacing mode that may or may not be the most appropriate for a given patient in MRI). Magnet mode and arrhythmia detection/therapies should be disabled. For non-pacemaker dependent patients, usually either a non-pacing (ODO/OVO/OAO) or inhibited mode (DDI/VVI/AAI) is appropriate, but can be an asynchronous mode (DOO/VOO/AOO) for some patients Pacemaker-dependent patients will generally be placed an asynchronous mode set at a level so as not to compete with their intrinsic heart rates . For patients with ICD's, tachy therapy shocking should be disabled as well as capacitor maintenance. Before, During, and After MRI . All paperwork and consents must be carefully reviewed before the patient enters the scanner room. Continuous visual monitoring with EKG, pulse oximetry and blood pressure should be performed. An external defibrillator should available on standby. After the exam, MRI-specific settings should be returned to pre-MRI values. Someone from the cardiac service should recheck all pacer parameters, including rechecking lead voltages, impedances, and sensing thresholds.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/newsafe-pacemakers.html"}

The technique we now know of as CASL (Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling) was the first true ASL method, described by Williams, Detre, and colleagues in the early 1990s. CASL used a constant, low-amplitude, continuous RF-pulse in conjunction with an imaging gradient to produce spin inversion of flowing blood proximal to the imaged slice. When these inverted spins flowed into the imaged slice they reduced its signal intensity slightly, detectable by a subtraction technique. Although now primarily of historical interest, the fundamental concepts embodied by CASL are needed to understand newer and more sophisticated ASL techniques. The inversion pulses used in CASL (and all ASL techniques) give rise to an interesting (and problematic) MR phenomenon, magnetization transfer (MT) . As described in a prior Q&A , MT occurs when an RF-pulse centered in the inversion slab \"spills over\" and indirectly lowers signal in the imaged slice. The MT effect takes place via off-resonance water-macromolecular interactions and is entirely separate from ASL signal changes caused by flow. The MT phenomenon occurs in normal imaging, but usually is not noticeable because it affects tissue signal in adjacent slices by only a few percent. In ASL, however, where the change in signal between tagged and control images is less than 1%, unwanted MT effects may overwhelm detection of the desired flow-related changes. All ASL techniques must therefore address how to cancel or diminish this MT effect. An illustration of the \"MT Problem\" and two solutions possible with the CASL method is given below. The MT problem and two CASL solutions. In the top row the MT Problem is illustrated. A single inversion pulse applied off-resonance (at a different resonance frequency and location) reduces signal from the imaged slab. This confounds calculation of the desired signal change (Signal control  Signal inversion ) reflecting perfusion. In the second row the original CASL solution is illustrated. Here the control image is obtained using a second inversion pulse identical to the first but applied on the opposite side of the imaged slice. The MT effects within the imaged slice are the same between Labeling and Control; they are eliminated when the two images are subtracted. \"CASL Solution #2\" a modification of the original technique by Alsop and Detre (1998). Here, the inversion pulse played out during the Control sequence is split into two parts (sidebands) by amplitude modulation. Since the sidebands have half the amplitude of the original pulse and are very close together, the MT effect on the imaged slice remains unchanged and disappears when the sequences are subtracted. The split pulse results in no net inversion of flowing spins in the Control sequence since the pair acts as two 180 pulses = 360 (a double inversion) when placed side-by-side. CASL techniques are now primarily of historical and didactic interest, having fallen out of favor by the late 1990s. The main problems with CASL were the high tissue energy deposition and transmitter duty-cycle requirements accompanying the use of continuous RF-pulses.

A single RF pulse generates a free induction decay (FID) , but two successive RF pulses produce a spin echo (SE) . The time between the middle of the first RF pulse and the peak of the spin echo is called the echo time (TE) . This remarkable discovery was made in 1949 by Erwin Hahn and can be counted among the most important developments in the history of NMR. But where does the SE come from? Creation of a spin echo. by two RF pulses. The first RF pulse generates an FID, while the second pulse generates the SE. The echo time (TE) is twice the interpulse interval. Erwin Hahn (1921-2016) The SE represents regeneration of spin phase information apparently lost during the decay of the FID. The \"rebirth\" of the FID as a SE is possible because many of the T2* processes which originally produced the decay of the FID are symmetrically reversible. In fact, most of the FID signal has not been destroyed; it has merely become \"disorganized\" because the individual spins comprising it have lost their phase coherence. The system is said to possess a \"hidden order\" or \"atomic memory\". By applying a second RF pulse, certain dephased components of the original FID can be refocused into a SE. The animation below shows how a spin echo is formed. The red arrows represent groups of spins that experience identical local fields and respond similarly. (Such groups of like-behaving spins are called spin isochromats , literally \"spins of the same color\".) The 90-pulse first tips these spins into the transverse plane. Because the local microscopic fields may differ slightly, some spin groups may precess faster (and gain phase) relative to others. This is represented by the spreading out of arrows in the transverse plane. The faster spins initially rotate toward the viewer and the slower spins rotate away. Formation of the spin echo from Wikipedia, created by Gavin W. Morley. Click on image for animation. The 180-pulse now turns the entire system on its head. An analogy to \"flipping a pancake\" is sometimes made. After the flip, the faster precessing spins now find themselves at the back of the pack. With continued evolution they eventually catch up with the slower spins. This occurs at time TE = 2 x t which is the center of the spin echo. Beyond the echo center the faster spins once again leave the slower ones behind and the system again dephases. Although the example above shows the generation of spin echoes by successive 90 and 180 pulses, these precise flip angles are not required. In fact, spin echoes are formed when two successive RF-pulses of any flip angle are employed! Hahn, in his original paper, used two 90 pulses. When flip angles other than 90 and 180 are employed, the resultant spin echo is sometimes referred to as a Hahn echo.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/spin-echo1.html"}

Historically, a variety of names and abbreviations have been applied to the process of recording the stimulated absorption and emission of energy from nuclei placed within a magnetic field. In the original physics literature of the 1940s, this phenomenon was called nuclear induction ; in the early 1950s, it was called nuclear paramagnetic resonance . Since the late 1950s, the term nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been the preferred name for this same physical process. When imaging methods using the NMR signal were first developed, the term NMR imaging was applied to them. At least partially because of patients' concerns over the dangers of nuclear energy, nuclear radioactivity, and the like, by the mid1980s the word \"nuclear\" had been largely dropped when referring to these imaging methods. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging , or simply MRI , became the preferred designation for this new radiologic technique. The lexicon has even further expanded now to include such terms as magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) , magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) , and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) . In current use, therefore, the term NMR is preferable when one is describing the physical phenomenon itself or when referring to the measurements of the nuclear induction signal in physics or chemistry laboratories. The word \"nuclear\" is dropped when referring to imaging or spectroscopic techniques for humans or animals. Most scientific journals prefer to use the phrase MR imaging (rather than MRI ) when referring to the clinical technique.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mr-vs-mri-vs-nmr.html"}

Small adjustments are made to currents passing through gradients and higher order shim coils to optimize B o field homogeneity in the presence of the patient. A more advanced manual process may be necessary for spectroscopy and chemical shift selective suppression applications. Coil tuning and matching . Human bodies differ in size and shape and thus create different electromagnetic \"loads\" on the RF-coils. As such, the resonance frequency of the patient-coil system must be adjusted as well as the coil impedance (complex resistance) for effective energy transfer. Center frequency adjustment . Human tissues contain both water and fat in various proportions whose resonance peaks differ by a few hundred hertz (Hz). The scanner must lock on to the correct spectral peak for proper localization. Transmitter attenuation/gain adjustment . The attenuator or amplifier gain of the RF pulse must be calibrated for each patient so that proper flip angle can be obtained. Receive attenuation/gain adjustment . The MR signal intensity must appropriately scaled so it is neither too big nor too small for the amplifier chain. Dummy cycles .

Although it may have many uses, the term functional MRI (fMRI) generally refers to the imaging of brain activation detectable by changes in regional cerebral blood flow. Increased blood flow alters the local ratio of (paramagnetic) deoxyhemoglobin to (diamagnetic) oxyhemoglobin, thus affecting T2 and T2*. Signal intensity variations in the MR image result from this so-called BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependent) contrast. In a typical clinical BOLD-fMRI experiment, the subject is asked to intermittently perform various tasks (such as finger tapping or silent word generation) while lying in the scanner. Echo-planar gradient echo whole brain images are obtained during the task and at rest. A statistical comparison between task and rest (plus additional processing) allows generation of activation maps that can be overlaid on anatomic images.

The choice of optimal imaging parameters is dependent upon the exact ASL method utilized (2D vs 3D, PICORE vs FAIR vs pCASL, etc.) Even small variations of each sequence (such as type of background suppression and pulse shaping) will affect parameter selection. Expected blood flows should also be considered, in that children have more robust circulations than adults. Many choices are empirical, so one should always begin with parameters recommended by the vendor or pulse sequence designer. That said, a few general rules are applicable to each implementation. Children have higher relative blood flows and shorter mean transit times than adults Plane of imaging . All ASL methods perform best when imaging is acquired in transverse planes perpendicular to the imaging slab. Equipment . Use highest field strength available. ASL techniques are signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limited, so all perform better at 3.0T than at 1.5T or below. Multi-channel coils are mandatory. A low-level of parallel acceleration ( R 2) may be useful for 3D acquisitions, but should be used judiciously in 2D methods due to its SNR penalty. Repetition time ( TR ) should be long enough to allow substantial relaxation of labeled spins between acquisitions, typically greater than 3500 ms. Minimum echo time ( TE ) should always be used to preserve signal from T2/T2* decay. Spatial resolution . Avoid \"high resolution\" imaging. At the current state of technology, SNR considerations mandate acquisition of images that are of lower spatial resolution than those used for standard diagnosis. For 2D ASL typical in plane matrices are in the 64x64 to 128x128 range, with corresponding slice thicknesses of 4-6 mm. For 3D ASL isotropic voxels are possible but are often still chosen to be anisotropic due to image acquisition time constraints. Signal averaging . To maintain acceptable SNR at reasonable imaging times (4-6 min), multiple signal averages will be required. For 2D techniques, between 30 and 50 signal averages are needed at 3.0T, and even more at 1.5T. For 3D techniques, 2-4 signal averages are required. Labeling duration and post labeling delay inversion time ( TI ) . These depend on field strength, ASL method, and expected flow velocities. For brain imaging at 1.5T, labeling durations of 700 ms for PASL and 1500 ms for pCASL with TI values of 1800 are typical. Due to the longer T1 values of blood at 3.0T, slightly longer TI's are required. TI should also be increased whenever slow arterial flows are expected, such as in elderly patients or those with vascular pathology or poor cardiac output. Conversely shorter TI values are recommended for children due to their more rapid circulation times. Crusher gradients . Their use is disputed. Although they reduce flow-related artifacts, they require prolongation of the minimum TE , thereby reducing SNR. They also introduce more T2 (T2*) contrast into the ASL image that must be taken into account for quantitative flow measurements. Crusher gradients can also potentially remove important clinical information from the ASL images, such as the presence of delayed or collateral flow. Background suppression . Required for segmented 3D imaging methods that use a single excitation per TR . Less effective/efficient for multi-slice 2D methods where they can be considered optional. Background suppression reduce ASL signal slightly (~5%), which should be accounted for if quantitative blood flow measurements are desired.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/asl-parameters.html"}

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Several types of incontinence and pelvic support devices may be encountered in the MRI setting: pessaries (used only by women), penile clamps (used only by men), and sling systems, urethral compression devices and artificial urinary sphincters (used by men and women). Pessaries Silicone and silicone/metal pessaries available from CooperSurgical. Pessaries are silicone or silcone+metal devices placed in the vagina for uterine prolapse and urinary incontinence. Although the use of pessaries has decreased significantly over the last few decades in favor of surgical options, they are still occasionally encountered in MR screening. Pure silicone pessaries are of course MR Safe but those made of metal covered with silicone are considered MR Unsafe due to concerns about heating. Most have not been rigorously tested using ASTM methods, however, so the unsafe designation is likely out of caution. Although some of these devices can be taken out by the patient, many can only be removed by a health care professional. If in doubt about the composition and whether the device should be removed before scanning, an x-ray of the pelvis will show if a metal substructure is present. Penile Clamps \"MR Unsafe\" Penis Clamp Penile clamps, also known as incontinence clamps or urinary cuffs, are widely available without a prescription over the counter and on-line. Although most are made of plastic, rubber, and/or foam, a number of models (including the Squeezer Klip, Uriclak, Cunningham, and J Clamp) contain steel and thus should be removed prior to MRI. Incontinence Sling Systems Slings made of autologous fascia or polypropylene mesh are sometimes surgically implanted to elevate the urethra and bladder base as a treatment for incontinence. All are MR Safe , with only the historic InVance System (AMS) being \"trivially\" MR Conditional because it relies on fixation to the pelvis with titanium screws. Urethral Compression Devices Another strategy to mitigate urinary incontinence is to implant adjustable balloons partially around the urethra near the bladder neck. Two systems are in common use and are both considered technically MR Conditional because they contain small silicone-coated titanium injection ports in the scrotum: \"MR Conditional\" ProACT system Adjustable Continence Therapy by Uromedica . The ProACT system is used for men, the ACT for women. Two small catheters with terminal balloons are surgically inserted along either side of the urethra, then filled with injected saline. Adjustable TransObturator Male System (ATOMS) by AMI. This device is fixed to the pelvis and acts like a sling, but also has a saline-distensible ventral cushion to push against the urethra. Artificial Urinary Sphincters Now nearly 40 years old, the AMS 800 Urinary Control System by Boston Scientific is still the most widely used artificial urinary sphincter in the world. A cuff surrounds the urethra which can be filled or emptied of fluid from a pressure-regulating reservoir by the patient squeezing a pump in his scrotum. Although nearly completely made of silicone, the pump mechanism contains valves with tiny metal springs, it is considered MR Conditional with only minimal constraints. Other artificial sphincters include the ZSI 375  ( Zephyr Surgical Implants ), the Victo  and Victo+  ( Promedon ), and the FlowSecure  ( RBM-Med ).

Yes, a number of different methods exist for suppressing high signal from fat to better visualize pathology or contrast enhancement. No single answer exists as to the \"best\" technique; the choice of technique depends on field strength, body part imaged, presence of gadolinium, proximity of metallic hardware, and clinical scenario. As an overview, water-fat separation methods are based on: 1) the water-fat chemical shift (resonance frequency difference); 2) the short T1 of fat; or 3) both (hybrid techniques). Chemical-shift Techniques In-Phase/Out-of-Phase Imaging . This is not really a fat-suppression technique, but is simple and straightforward method to characterize tissues based on differences in water and fat resonance frequencies. By slight adjustment of the echo time ( TE ), signals from water and fat protons in the same voxel can be made to constructively or destructively interfere. This method is used primarily in abdominal imaging to characterize certain diseases (adrenal adenomas, hepatic steatosis). Dixon Technique(s) . A group of techniques closely related to the qualitative in-phase/out-of-phase imaging methods described above. Acquiring 2, 3 or more echoes at different TE's, \"water only\" and \"fat only\" images can be extracted through sophisticated mathematical processing. Fat quantification is also possible. The Dixon technique is widely used in abdominal imaging, imaging of the extremities, and the spine. It is less sensitive to Bo and B1 heterogeneity than CHESS/Fat-Sat methods. CHESS (Fat-Sat) . This is the most widely used method for fat suppression. An RF-pulse tuned to the fat resonance frequency together with a spoiler gradient saturates and dephases fat protons, leaving only water protons to produce a signal. The technique is very versatile and can be appended to any pulse sequence. It works best at 1.0T and higher and cannot be used below 0.3T (due to close position of spectral peaks). It requires a homogeneous field to work properly and thus may fail around metallic hardware, imaging far from isocenter, or in anatomic regions with susceptibility distortions (sinuses, head and neck). Water Excitation . Instead of suppressing fat, these techniques use a short series of RF pulses to selectively excite water protons. No spoilers are needed. To date, water excitation methods have been used primarily in the musculoskeletal system, especially for evaluation of cartilage. Some 3D applications in the breast and liver have also been reported. Technique Based on Short T1 of Fat Short TI Inversion Recovery (STIR) . This is another widely used sequence applicable at all field strengths. Because fat has a shorter T1 than nearly all other materials in the body, its signal can be selectively nulled using a magnitude-reconstructed inversion recovery sequence with short TI values (150-180 msec at 1.5T). The method is relatively insensitive to field inhomogeneities and can be used near metal and over large fields-of-view. The signal suppression is not specific to fat; any short T1 material (e.g., melanin, methemoglobin, mucus) will be nulled. Thus STIR cannot be used post-gadolinium to demonstrate contrast-enhancement, its most important limitation. Hybrid Techniques SPIR and SPAIR . These techniques combine a greater than 90 chemical-shift selective (CHESS) pulse with an inversion delay and spoiling to null the signal from fat. The main difference between SPIR (Spectral Presaturation with Inversion Recovery) and SPAIR (Spectral Attenuated Inversion Recovery) is that the latter uses a full 180 adiabatic inverting pulse that is insensitive to B 1 inhomogeneity. Both methods are sensitive to B o inhomogeneities.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/best-method.html"}

Several brands of scanners have automated shim procedures specifically designed for the area of study (brain, ankle, cardiac, neck, breast, etc). On other brands a shim volume must be specified as well as the intensity/complexity of shimming desired. Additional shimming is highly recommended for whenever there is a change of gradient mode, change in table position, or change in anatomic region studied. It is especially useful over irregularly shaped areas (like the neck, wrist, ankle, and foot) or areas where there are steep changes in susceptibility (skull base, chest).

Several methods are available for first-pass perfusion imaging but none has yet emerged as the unequivocal best choice. Any sequence selected for myocardial perfusion should ideally have the following characteristics: MR signal linearly related to gadolinium concentration Spatial coverage allowing acquisition of at least 3-4 slices within the allotted time frame Temporal resolution sufficient to acquire these slices within 1-2 heart beats Short acquisition time per slice ( 200 ms) to minimize motion artifact Sufficient in-plane resolution ( 2.5mm) to distinguish the myocardial layers Cine images from 1st pass myocardial perfusion study using a saturation recovery spoiled-GRE method Sequences for first-pass perfusion consist of a magnetization preparation period followed by an image acquisition module. The purpose of the preparatory module is to reduce the signal of non-enhancing tissue so that gadolinium-enhancing blood and myocardium will be rendered more conspicuous. (This is analogous to background suppression commonly used in MR angiography to accentuate vessels). Saturation recovery (SR) uses non-slice-selective 90-pulses that tip the longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) of all tissues in the imaging volume into the transverse plane. A crusher gradient (G) is typically applied immediately after the pulse to destroy transverse coherences. After being tipped into the transverse plane tissues begin to recover longitudinal magnetization as a function of their T1 values. Gadolinium-containing blood and myocardium have short T1's and recover quickly, while non-enhancing myocardium and other tissues remain relatively saturated/suppressed. An image acquisition module is then played out using a rapid sequence (spoiled-GRE, balanced-SSFP, or hybrid GRE-EPI).

Between 64 and 128 lines of k -space are sampled for each slice with the center line at \"inversion\" time TI where an appreciable difference in signal is noted between enhancing and non-enhancing tissues. Even better contrast between enhancing and non-enhancing tissues could be obtained by waiting a little longer between the saturation pulse and image acquisition (i.e., increasing TI ). However, this would significantly lengthen imaging time per slice and reduce the maximum number of slices possible in a given R-R interval. Slice profile of a \"notched\" RF-pulse. Slices 1 and 3 in the passband feel the brunt of the RF-pulse and are saturated, while Slice 2 (in the notch) is spared.

The terms cardiac gating and cardiac triggering are largely used interchangeably. Some relatively subtle distinctions are occasionally made, however. Gating vs Triggering In the strictest sense triggering is a form of prospective gating where MR data acquisition only begins after detection of a desired physiologic event (an R-wave or peripheral pulse). Triggering is used to obtain static images at a particular time in the cardiac cycle. Gating is a somewhat broader term than triggering; it may be either prospective or retrospective. In retrospective gating , MR data are acquired continuously (not in response to a particular cardiovascular \"trigger\" event). The EKG or pulse is recorded simultaneously with the MR data. The MR data can then be reordered, grouped, or correlated with phase of the cardiac cycle. Retrospective gating is the method typically used for cine-cardiac motion studies. Prospective gating (triggering) acquires data during a specific acquisition window between R-waves. Retrospective gating collects data continuously then groups and fills k -space according to the phase of the cardiac cycle. Methods for Cardiac Gating/Triggering Cardiac contractions can be detected by EKG or a peripheral pulse transducer. Some type of EKG-based triggering is mandatory for imaging the heart (and often advisable for imaging of the lower thorax).

The evolution of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on MRI differs significantly from hemorrhages confined to the brain parenchyma. Clots in the subarachnoid space are usually small, multiple, and diffuse. They are exposed to, and mixed with, cerebrospinal fluid, which has high pO 2 values. High ambient oxygen levels mean that SAH will evolve more slowly than parenchymal hematomas on MRI. In the hyperacute phase of SAH, slight shortening of T1 occurs due to the increased protein and new cellular content within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This produces a dirty CSF appearance on T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images, while T2-weighted images are generally not affected. It should be noted that small degrees of SAH in this phase may be difficult to detect by MRI, leaving CT as the preferred diagnostic modality for the hyperacute clinical scenario. T2/T2*-shortening occurs with transition to deoxyhemoglobin, but decreased signal may be difficult to appreciate on T2-weighted images unless the hemorrhage is massive or collects in the ventricular system. Susceptibility-weighted (SW) or gradient echo (GRE) images may be better for SAH detection during this phase, although T2-FLAIR remains an important diagnostic sequence at all stages. Transition to methemoglobin with shortening on T1-weighted images is often delayed to late in the first week after SAH. In mild SAH this phase may never be seen as the hemoglobin may be diluted, resorbed, or dispersed before methemoglobin formation occurs. If present, however, the T1-shortening from methemoglobin may allow diagnosis of SAH at a time when CT images have returned to normal. Even though T1 shortening occurs, T2-FLAIR may still be superior for detection even in this later period. The two cases below show how certain MR sequences, especially T2-FLAIR, Gradient/Susceptibility, and diffusion-weighted imaging may reveal subarachnoid hemorrhage when CT is negative or equivocal. CT T2-weighed MR T2-FLAIR Gradient echo Case 1 (Above) . CT and MRI 5 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT and T2-weighed MRI are negative.

Implantable infusion pumps have been used clinically for 30 years, but today only three companies manufacture all such devices used worldwide : Medtronic , Flowonix , and Tricumed (the latter's offerings not available in the USA). Additionally, several \"legacy\" pumps, produced up until the mid-2010's may occasionally be encountered, including the Codman  3000 , Isomed, and SynchroMed  EL. Implanted infusion pumps can be divided into two types based on their mechanism of fluid propulsion. \"MR Conditional\" Codman 3000 implantable infusion pump. Propellant-driven Pumps The simplest types of implantable infusion pumps do not contain a motor, but rely on thermal expansion of a gaseous propellant to force drug delivery into the catheter. Examples of such pumps include the legacy Codman  3000 ( Johnson & Johnson ) and Isomed ( Medtronic ) pumps and those currently manufactured by Flowonix ( Prometra) and Tricumed ( LENUS Pro , IP2000V , and Siromedes ). As shown in the schematic right, such pumps have two compartments: 1) a collapsible titanium bellows serving as the drug reservoir, and 2) a surrounding chamber containing a flurochlorocarbon propellant in gas-vapor equilibrium. As the device heats to body temperature, the propellant expands, compressing the bellows and driving drug delivery into the catheter. Various valves and filters control the flow. The devices listed above are all considered MR Conditional at 1.5 and/or 3.0T. Because RF-heating of the pump may occur during scanning, the possibility of increased drug flow (related to temperature-induced propellant expansion) should be considered and high SAR protocols avoided. Prometra pumps have an additional unique limitation in that their drug reservoirs must be emptied before entering the MR environment. This requirement resulted from a 2017 incident where the strong magnetic field opened inlet and outlet valves resulting in a complete discharge of pump contents and patient death. \"MR Conditional\" SynchroMed II implantable infusion pump Motor-driven Peristaltic Pumps These pumps, typified by the Medtronic SynchroMed  series, contain a battery, electric motor, and rollers on a rotating wheel that serially compress the internal tubing for drug propulsion. Electric pumps are more complex than propellant-driven ones, containing microelectronics for precise control over infusion rates, remote programming, and interrogation. SynchroMed pumps are all rated as MR Conditional, so the usual limits on field strength, spatial field gradient, etc. apply. But due to their sophisticated design several additional conditions must be followed: Palpation of the implanted pump should be performed to ensure that it has not rotated into a position perpendicular to the long axis of the body (and B o field). This orientation may demagnetize the pump motor, rendering it permanently inoperable. The shunt is expected to stop operating when the patient is placed in the scanner, resulting in temporary cessation of drug delivery. This may be dangerous for some patients, particularly those receiving intrathecal baclofen , where a life-threatening withdrawal reaction may occur. Upon removal from the scanner the pump must be interrogated to make sure it is no longer stalled. On rare occasions the pump may take several hours to restart.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/implanted-infusion-pumps.html"}

At least 6 different artifacts are commonly noted in time-of-flight (TOF) MRA studies. These are illustrated and briefly discussed below: Stair-Step Artifact (2D TOF only) This simplest form of this artifact is a subtle pixelated appearance to obliquely oriented vessels. This occurs because the slices in 2D are relatively thick (1-3 mm) compared to the in-plane spatial resolution of 0.5-1.0 mm. Stair-step artifacts can be minimized by overlapping slices by 25-30%. This means more slices are needed to cover the same area, however, with a concomitant increase in scan time. Mild \"stair-step\" artifact due to non-isotropic voxels More severe stair-step artifacts occur when subtle or gross motion occurs between the individually acquried 2D slices. Mild motion artifact causing horizontal banding on this 2D-TOF MRA of the aorta Severe artifacts with jagged edges due to gross motion for carotid TOF MRA study In-Plane Saturation Artifact TOF MRA relies on the inflow of fresh (unsaturated) blood to produce high intravascular signal. This signal is highest whenever the direction of flow is perpendicular to the primary imaging plane. When vessels travel within plane, their blood may become saturated like stationary tissues, resulting in decreased signal. This may occur with either 2D or 3D TOF techniques 3D-TOF MRA showing artifactual in-plane signal loss within both middle cerebral arteries 2D-TOF MRA shows artifactual in-plane signal loss in horizontal portions of both anterior tibial arteries Shine-through Artifacts Both 2D and 3D TOF MR angiographic images are displayed using a maximum intensity projection (MIP) algorithm. The MIP selects all pixels having an arbitrary minimum signal intensity (e.g., 2 standard deviations above background). In addition to bright blood vessels, any other material with high signal intensity will \"shine through\" and \"contaminate\" the MIP image. Since underlying TOF MRA pulse sequences are T1-weighted, short T1 materials (hematoma, gadolinium, fat) are primarily responsible for this phenomenon. However, any high signal focus (due to motion or susceptibility) could create problems in interpretation. 3D TOF MRA showing shine through of high signal from hematoma (H) and fat (F) at skull base CSF inflow phenomenon (on source image below) creates artifact on MIP image (above) Flow-Reversal Artifact This is more of a pitfall rather than an artifact, but an important one of which to be aware. Recall that TOF techniques typically employ traveling saturation pulses to eliminate signal from veins flowing in the opposite direction. But what happens if an artery has retrograde flow due to some abnormal condition? Yes, it will be suppressed as well and not seen on the TOF MRA. An example is shown below of a patient with subclavian steal syndrome that causes flow in the left vertebral artery to be reversed. Similar phenomena may be seen in the pelvis and lower extremities where collaterals around stenotic lesions may follow a retrograde course. 2D TOF MRA shows only right vertebral artery. No flow related signal in the left vertebral artery is seen. Contrast-enhanced MRA shows retrograde filling of left vertebral artery (subclavian steal phenomenon) Venetian Blind Artifact (3D MRA only) This is a specific artifact seen only with the MOTSA (Multiple Overlapping Thin Slab Acquisition) technique. It represents overlap between adjacent slabs that are acquired as separate acquisitions and then fused together. The MOTSA technique is described in more detail in another Q&A . Susceptibility Artifacts Susceptibility refers to the magnetic field distortion that occurs especially at air-tissue interfaces and near metallic objects. These distortions create magnetic gradients that cause accelerated dephasing of spins, signal loss, and spatial distortion. In MRA susceptibility artifacts are commonly encountered around surgical clips, endovascular coils, and stents. When mild, these artifacts may suggest vascular narrowing or stenosis when none exists. When severe they may cause complete loss of flow-related enhancement falsely suggesting occlusion. Source image shows susceptibility field distortion due to aneurysm clip MRA show spurious loss of flow in entire right middle cerebral artery territory due to susceptibility artifact from clip", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mra-artifacts-tof.html"}

The sequence with the gray background you are describing is called phase-corrected or phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) .

Magnitude (left) and phase-corrected (right) inversion recovery images. All other parameters are the same (TR=5000, TI=350, TE=40) With magnitude reconstruction the direction of the longitudinal component of magnetization (ie, whether it is points in the +z or  z direction) is irrelevant.

Under magnitude reconstruction, air (and any tissue whose magnetization lies is at the zero crossing point at time TI ) appears black. Magnitude reconstructed IR is often represented on a \"bounce point\" diagram, showing values of M z < 0 reflected and displayed as positive. Phase-corrected IR preserves the information about M z polarity, with more negative values rendered increasingly darker. In the image (left) scalp fat is the brightest substance and CSF the darkest.

The potential harmful effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) continue to be debated, especially their role in causing cancer. Numerous research reports over the last 40 years have claimed that children who live near power lines and adults whose occupations expose them to high electromagnetic fields (e.g., linemen, electrical workers) have an increased risk of leukemia and other neoplasms. Irradiation by cell phones has been blamed for the development of intracranial gliomas and schwannomas, as well as diminished fertility (if you carry one in your pocket). Even electric blankets and household appliances such as electric shavers, computers, microwave ovens, televisions, and washing machines have come under scrutiny as possible environmental hazards. At the same time, an overwhelming number of other scientific studies have found no justification for these concerns. How then, do we balance these competing claims, and what is a \"regular\" person to do? First, let me go on record as saying that I do agree with expert panels and official statements from virtually all the major world government and scientific organizations (many referenced below, up to date through 2020) - there is no conclusive proof that the electromagnetic fields at levels most humans routinely experience in their everyday lives creates any significant adverse health effects . And for those of us working in and around MRI, where the typical exposures are low and of relatively short duration, I believe we should have no worries at all about non-thermal biological effects. In order to know how to live and recommend policy decisions in light of some present uncertainty, the concept of \" prudent avoidance \" put forth by Professor Granger Morgan over 20 years ago may prove useful. Under this doctrine, we should attempt to incorporate the current level of evidence (including worst case scenarios) into our decision making, such as our choice of home, job, or activity. For example, suppose there is some evidence suggests that living under power lines might increase the risk of childhood cancer incidence from 1:10,000 to 3:10,000 per year. This degree of increased risk should be incorporated into an array of factors used to make decisions concerning what constitutes an acceptable health risk in daily living. Other decisions (e.g., riding a motorcycle, smoking, not exercising) may prove much more important in determining one's overall health risk than whether one chooses to live under power lines, work in a magnet factory, or sleep under an electric blanket at night. As for me, I live far away from overhead power lines, but have worked thousands of hours in the MR center inside the 5-Gauss line. I press my cell phone firmly against my ear and don't think twice about standing near the microwave oven to watch my bowl of soup heat up for lunch.

{"id": "a04255cb-e6cd-4206-ab04-11e16c058128", "contents": "MRS Artifacts What MRS artifacts should we know about? As with other specialized MR techniques a variety of artifacts may affect spectral quality. Some of the most important are briefly described below. Poor Shimming Beneficial effect of shimming Shimming is an iterative adjustment process to improve magnetic field homogeneity within a spectroscopic volume. First order shimming is now entirely automated on clinical scanners, but occasionally second order (manual) shimming may be needed. As shown left, poor shimming can be recognized by spectral lines that are too wide, short, and poorly separated. Incomplete water suppression Because metabolites of interest exist in such low concentrations in tissues, suppression of water signal is an essential component of nearly all H spectroscopic examination. When water suppression fails or proves inadequate, the metabolite spectra may be inapparent or lost in background noise. Absorption and dispersion modes of an MRS spectrum Phasing Errors The time domain NMR signal in a spectroscopy experiment is typically considered to be an exponentially decaying sine wave or FID (Free Induction Decay) . After Fourier transformation, the FID becomes a complex-valued function in the frequency domain known as a Lorentzian . Lorentzian functions have both \"real\" and \"imaginary\" components in a fixed 90  (quadrature) relationship to one another. The relative values of these two components, however, depend on the initial (and generally unknown) phase offset ( ) of the FID. In the ideal case where  = 0, the real component of the Lorentzian has the desired shape of a narrow, upright spectral peak known as the absorption mode lineshape . The imaginary component becomes an generally undesirable biphasic waveform known as the dispersion mode lineshape . Overly wide and short peaks in a spectrum commonly result when the absorption and dispersion modes are mixed. Through a procedure known as phasing , the spectrum is adjusted to display the optimal absorption mode waveform. The initial step (frequency-independent or zero-order phasing) adjusts the phase offset to optimize a single spectral line. But because the phase offsets of different peaks may vary as a function of frequency, a second step (linear or first-order phasing) is also often used. The process may be repeated in an iterative fashion until the best possible spectrum is obtained. Phasing is largely automated on today's scanners, but sometimes requires manual intervention. Mismapping of lactate (yellow) and myo-Inositol (blue) due to chemical shift displacement. Chemical Shift Displacement Chemical shift displacement artifacts between metabolites in MRS are identical in nature to familiar fat-water artifacts seen on conventional MRI. Consider, for example, a brain voxel containing lactate (Lac) and myo-inositol (mI). Their chemical shift difference is 2.3 ppm, which translates into a frequency difference of about 300 Hz at 3.0T. If the transmit RF-bandwidth defining the voxel were 1500 Hz, then the two metabolites would be spatially mismapped about 20% (300/1500) relative to one another. Because this displacement would occur in all 3 directions, only (1 0.20) = 51% overlap would occur in the entire voxel, even though the two resonances should coincide exactly. Chemical shift displacement artifacts are most problematic with single voxel spectra at higher magnetic fields. The general solution is to employ larger bandwidth RF pulses and stronger imaging gradients. Multi-voxel Spectral Contamination Spectral contamination refers to the erroneous assignment of metabolite signals to the wrong voxel. As described above, chemical shift displacement is one source of localized spectral contamination prevalent in single-voxel spectroscopy. In multi-voxel spectroscopy a more insidious form of spectral contamination occurs that may be extend many voxels away from its source. This is a type of aliasing similar to the more familiar Gibbs (ringing) artifact seen on conventional MRI. Point spread function (psf) Because typical spectroscopic grids are in the range of 8x8 to 32x32, a significant truncation of the digitized signal must take place. After Fourier transformation the spectral peaks arising from a voxel spread out in ripples to its neighbors, described mathematically as the point spread function (psf) . This effect can be reduced (but not completely eliminated) through digital filtering techniques and increasing the number of voxels.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mrs-artifacts.html"}
{"id": "807aaa5c-8860-48ff-9d86-4c9776dffe69", "contents": "Additional Orbital Safety Issues Besides foreign bodies, are there any other eye-related potential hazards to be aware of in MRI? Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Yes. Several immediately come to mind. Cosmetics All eye make-up, especially mascara, should be removed prior to imaging. Such cosmetics often contain iron oxides that create a local artifact and may even result in eye irritation during MR imaging. Permanent eye-liner and periorbital tattoos may cause local swelling and pain even hours after scanning. Although some experts have recommended placing cold packs on the eyes preemptively, we simply warn the patient about this possibility and tell them to notify us immediately if any discomfort is experienced. Susceptibility artifact from iron particles in mascara Recently magnetic artificial eyelashes have become available which constitute a potential MR safety hazard as well as a source of artifacts. Instead of glue, the user paints on a black eyeliner containing ultrafine magnetic particles. The lashes themselves contain thin magnetic strips at their bases to attach to the lids. Both the lashes and eyeliner should be removed prior to imaging. Artificial Lenses Virtually all intraocular lens (IOL) implants are made entirely of plastic or silicone, and thus present no safety concerns in the MR environment. In a few older models, metallic loops made of platinium, iridium or titanium may be attached to the lens for suturing purposes; however, all tested to date have demonstrated no significant heating or displacement at field strengths up to 7.0T. One relatively new complex IOL, the implantable miniature telescope , is considered MR Conditional because it contains a small stainless steel part in its center, so there are restrictions on maximum field and gradient strength. Acrylic Intraocular Lens Implant Worst Medallion Implant with metal loops VisionCare implantable miniature telescope Conventional external contact lenses are also entirely safe, even the new fully implantable ones. It should be noted that certain cosmetic \"circle\" lenses contain iron oxide pigments that can produce a localized artifact on MR images (but without apparent adverse health effects). The single MR Unsafe implant in this category is the relatively new Sensimed Triggerfish , a contact lens with an embedded micro-sensor that captures spontaneous circumferential changes at the corneoscleral area (an indirect index for anterior chamber size and hence intraocular pressure). These uncommonly used devices are implanted for a 24-hour period to continuously monitor intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients, then removed. Black \"circle\" contact lens MR Unsafe Triggerfish contact lens Eyelid Weights and Springs Internal palpebral weights made of gold, platinum, or platinum-iridium and are inserted in the pretarsal space of the upper lid to passively assist with lid closure in patients with facial nerve palsy. Although most are probably safe even up to 7.0T, some are labeled MR Conditional by manufacturers (out of an abundance of caution, I suppose). Externally applied weights are also available, such as the Blinkeze plate held in place by an adhesive strip. Even though made of (non-ferromagnetic) tantalum, such external weights should be removed prior to MRI to eliminate the possibility of skin burns. Gold weight positioned over upper lid prior to surgery and postoperative orbit x-ray Blinkeze external eyelid weight Implanted palpebral springs, more widely used in the 1970s and 1980s than today, assist with active closure of the lid. These devices are not commercially produced, but each is individually crafted by the surgeon using stainless steel, Nitinol (nickel-titanium), or nonferrous 35 NLT alloy wire. Although some concerns about movement within 1 month of placement and localized discomfort have been voiced, many patients have undergone uneventful MRI at 3T or less with the only precaution being placement of a protective plastic covering and eye patch. Morel-Fatio palpebral spring Glaucoma Devices Metal EX-PRESS glaucoma shunt Implanted glaucoma devices are used to reduce intraocular pressure by removing aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye. They are virtually all constructed out of silicone or plastic and are considered MR Safe (with two exceptions): The first exception is the metal EX-PRESS Glaucoma Filtration Device , a 2-3 mm long pointed stainless steel tube that is implanted under a scleral flap. The tube drains fluid from the anterior chamber into the intrascleral space. The EX-PRESS mimics a foreign body on x-ray and creates a local artifact on MR. It is considered MR Conditional up to 3.0T with the additional caveat that the manufacturer does not recommend scanning in the first 2 weeks post implantation. \"MR conditional\" Hydrus microstent The second exception is the Hydrus Microstent (Ivantis), a crescent-shaped device made of non-ferromagnetic nitinol (an alloy of nickel and titanium) placed in Schlemms canal near the corneal-iris junction. (Schlemms canal is a lymphatic-like vessel in the deep cornea whose function is to drain aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the episcleral blood vessels). Like the EX-PRESS Device, the Hydrus is MR Conditional up to 3.0T. Scleral Banding Scleral buckling or banding is used to treat chronic retinal detachment. The procedure involves encircling the globe with a belt, band, buckle, or tire-like structure made of silicone or hydrogel, occasionally held in place by metallic clip. For the last 30 years, these clips have been made of tantalum, and hence pose no risk of movement in an external magnetic field. T2-weighted image showing scleral band Eye Prostheses Eye prosthesis with globe (G) and scleral shell (S). The globe is dense due to its hydroxyapatite composition, not to be construed as metallic. The typical prosthetic eye consists of: 1) a posterior globe component, commonly made of hydroxyapatite, porous polyethlyene, acrylic , silicone, or bioceramic; and 2 ) a removable anterior shell, made of acrylic or occasionally glass and painted to resemble the normal eye. The extraocular muscles may or may not be sutured to the implant. Some patients have only a scleral shell without a posterior globe prosthesis. Because none of these components in standard eye prostheses contain metal, they are all considered MR Safe . Some eye prostheses have a titanium peg that couples the anterior and posterior components so they move together. These are also \"MR safe\". As a warning, a small number of legacy MEDPOR prostheses implanted in the 2000-2010 time frame that contain a small magnet in the shell magnetically coupled to a ferromagnetic screw on the globe component. MR scanning of these prostheses is contraindicated. Miscellaneous and Uncommon Devices Boston Keratoprosthesis (MRI Conditional) Corneal Implants. The Boston Kerato-prosthesis is designed as an artificial cornea for patients with previous failed graft attempts. The collar-button-like device attaches to the native cornea and contains consists of a clear sheet of plastic holding a donor graft and affixed to a back plate with locking titanium ring. Because of the possible tissue heating near the metal component, the device is considered MR Conditional. ' Electronic Retinal Implants . Two devices, the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System and the IRIS II have been granted CE mark for use in Europe (the Argus also has FDA approval in the US). Both devices comprise an epiretinal electrode array located on the surface of the retina together with an eyeglass-mounted digital camera transmitting signals wirelessly to the impant's receiver. With the external hardware removed, both devices are considered MR Conditional at fields up to 3.0T. Argus II Retinal Prosthesis (MRI Conditional) Extruded retinal tack (from Schwering under CC BY) Retinal tacks made of plastic or metal were reasonably popular in the 1980s as an adjunct for repair of complicated retinal detachments. At least one of these tacks, the Western European model, was made of ferromagnetic steel and has long been singled out as MR Unsafe . Retinal tacks are seldom used today because of their general commercial unavailability and associated complications. However, the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis uses a single titanium retinal tack to hold the electrode array in place and is MR Conditional.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/additional-orbit-safety.html"}
{"id": "bcaeaf9a-54d4-4b41-a7e1-b33a88ae2c34", "contents": "MRS Quantitation Can MRS peaks be quantified? How accurate is this? As a first approximation, the area under a given spectral peak should be directly proportional to the concentration of nuclei giving rise to that peak. It should be noted that this is not the same as metabolite concentration, as a single metabolite molecule may contain two or more NMR-active nuclei. Early attempts at clinical MRS quantitation followed methods used in chemistry laboratories  calculation of peak areas via simple numerical integration. It was soon realized that the peak areas depend on multiple additional factors, including the T1 and T2 values of each metabolite, B o and B 1 inhomogeneities, eddy currents, the type of pulse sequence, TR and TE . Even with these effects corrected, spectral line fitting and integration is still difficult because many MRS resonances overlap, are broadened by inhomogeneities, are superimposed on a wandering baseline, and have complex splitting patterns. In the 1990s accurate spectral curve fitting was significantly improved using advanced prior knowledge about the location and line shapes of expected metabolites. Such metabolite basis sets can be applied to extract a more quantifiable spectrum from the noisy raw data. This concept is applied to the most widely used algorithms today, Provencher's commercially available LCModel and several methods in the freeware jMRUI toolbox (available at www.jmrui.eu ). Use of advanced prior knowledge to improve spectral line fitting. A basis set (left) incorporates chemical shifts, T2 relaxation times, and line shapes of expected metabolites. The basis set is used to extract a corrected spectrum of the detected components from noisy raw data (lower right). (From Boska et al, Mol Neurodegen 2014;9:58 under CC BY License) Curve fitting programs can provide only relative metabolite concentrations, so additional methods or assumptions must be used to estimate absolute tissue concentrations from spectra. One possibility is to use an external reference standard (e.g. a test tube containing metabolites or chemicals at known concentrations) taped directly to the subject. This method introduces errors produced by B 1 and B o field inhomogeneities and susceptibility effects. It is more commonly used for non- H MRS. Alternatively, MRS calibration can be made to an internal reference, such as tissue water, whose concentration is independently known. A commercial example of this is GE's PROBE-SVQ , which acquires a set non-water suppressed excitations as a reference prior to a conventional water-suppressed sequence. The concentration of brain metabolites can then be estimated by comparing their area ratios to that of tissue water, which is often assumed to be constant at 55.5 mol/kg. The accuracy of these \"absolute\" measurements varies by technique and is in most cases unknown. Both internal and external calibration methods contain \"correction factors\" that warp measured values into reasonable physiological ranges. I am rather skeptical of any metabolite concentrations values reported to more than 2 significant digits, and my personal experience has been that even careful repeated measurements in the same patient may vary by 10-20%. I suggest that you follow the Elster Principle of healthy skepticism when assessing absolute values of metabolite concentrations at our current stage of technology.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/metabolite-quantitation.html"}

When prescribing an MR spectroscopy exam, one of the fundamental decisions is whether to acquire data from a single voxel or from multiple voxels. Single-voxel spectroscopy Multi-voxel spectroscopy Single-voxel spectroscopy (SVS) techniques are the simplest to acquire and interpret, and hence are the most widely used. They provide high signal-to-noise in a relatively short scan time. Because the imaged region is compact, excellent shimming can be obtained with resultant high-quality spectra suitable for quantitative analysis. Multi-voxel Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) techniques offer two potential advantages over SVS: 1) a larger total coverage area (since the size of the entire multivoxel slab is greater), and 2) higher spatial resolution (since the individual voxels are smaller). A wide coverage area is important for large, heterogenous lesions like the brain tumor shown above, where the SVS technique provides data from only a small portion of the mass. The smaller size of individual voxels in a multi-voxel CSI study may be critical when evaluating small organs like the prostate, where SVS is impractical. Smaller voxels are also advantageous when studying small or irregularly shaped anatomic structures even in larger organs like the brain. Here partial volume effects are reduced by excluding unwanted structures (such as other nuclei, CSF or scalp fat) from the spectral region. Disadvantages of multi-voxel CSI include: 1) Longer set-up and imaging time; 2) difficulties obtaining homogenous shim over the entire region; 3) lower signal-to-noise and spectral quality for individual voxels; 4) spectral contamination from adjacent voxels.

This was first demonstrated by Mayo et al in 1989. However, many other tissues, including the myocardium, have T1 values in the same range as blood. Thus using a single IR technique at this TI null will not only suppress the signal from blood, but also the signal of these surrounding tissues. The contrast between blood and the myocardial wall is relatively poor when a single IR technique is used. Additionally, inflow effects (bringing fully magnetized new blood into the imaging volume) may change the effective T1 of blood within a slice. Hence a single TI value suitable for slowly flowing blood may not effectively suppress the signal from rapidly inflowing blood. As a result of these limitations and problems, single IR black blood techniques have largely been abandoned in favor of double and triple IR methods.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-not-single-ir.html"}

Shallow Neural Network As described in the prior Q&A , a shallow neural network has only one (or just a few) hidden layers between the input and output layers. The input layer receives the data, the hidden layer(s) process it, and the final layer produces the output. Shallow neural networks are simpler, more easily trained, and have greater computational efficiency than deep neural networks , which may have thousands of hidden units in dozens of layers. Shallow networks are typically used for simpler tasks such as linear regression, binary classification, or low-dimensional feature extraction. Technically speaking, a neural network with more than one hidden layer is no longer considered a shallow neural network. In some cases, however, a neural network with 2 or 3 hidden layers, each with a small number of hidden units and having simple connectivity between them may produce straightforward outputs and may still be considered a \"shallow\" network. Four common shallow ML techniques are used in image processing applications for MRI, illustrated and discussed below. Various Shallow Neural Networks (modified from Argentiero et al under CC BY) Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a shallow supervised ML technique most commonly used to solve classification problems, especially where the outcome is binary, such as (A or B), (yes or no), and (malignant or benign). Logistic regression is similar to the more familiar linear regression, except that in the latter the output can take on any value. In logistic regression the output is constrained to just two (or at most a few) discrete values. At the heart of logistic regression lies the logistic function , f(x) = 1 / (1 + e x ), which has a sigmoidal shape and returns a value between 0 and 1 for all inputs x . During training, the system is provided with correctly classified cases, each described by one or more inputs. The logistic regression algorithm then calculates linear combinations of the inputs and optimizes parameters via a maximum likelihood method that generates odds ratios close to either 0 or 1, depending to which binary class the inputs correspond. Once the parameters are optimized, the model can be used to classify outcomes when new unknown data are presented. Support Vector Machine (SVM) In a SVM data is segregated into two classes, each represented by points in space separated by as large a distance as possible. A dividing boundary separates the classes. The choice of the boundary is taken as the one that maximizes the distance (the \"margin\") between the boundary and the closest point in each group. In other words, the best boundary is the one that cleanly divides the data but doesn't approach either group too closely. The data points lying closest the boundary are called the support vectors. They represent the points most difficult to classify and have a direct bearing on the optimal position of the boundary. For simple classification problems the boundary is just a straight line or plane. In more complex cases it may be necessary to construct a non-linear boundary such as a parabola, circle, or hyperplane. This is performed by transformation of the data into a higher dimension using a so-called kernel function. Like logistic regression, the optimal boundary in SVM is calculated using a training set whose classifications and inputs are known. New cases are then classified as to which side of the boundary they fall. SVM methods may be extended to more than two classes (albeit with some difficulty). Random Forest The Random Forest is a machine learning technique for classification and prediction of data. The building block of the Random Forest is the Decision Tree . Decision trees are relatively straightforward and simple to construct. For example, a decision tree for classifying a ball as football, golf ball, or tennis ball might include two initial branches dealing with shape (round or oblong), with two additional branches along the round into and size (larger or smaller than 4 cm). The major problem with simple decision trees is their high variance -- they commonly overfit the data and do not generalize well to samples beyond the training set. Random Forests were developed to overcome these problems. Instead of a single tree, Random Forests consist of a large ensemble of individual trees constructed using a randomly selected data from subsets of the original variables. Once the trees are constructed they are tested with known data and the various trees in the forest are scored for their accuracy in prediction. They can thus be used to rank the most important variables in the data. Additional advantages include insensitivity to outliers, ability to handle new data without changing dramatically, and ability to handle missing data. Cluster Analysis Unlike the three supervised machine learning techniques above, Cluster Analysis is unsupervised . Its goal is to subdivide large data sets into clusters , groups of objects that have similar properties or features compared to other groups. Popular clustering methods used imaging applications include: K-means Clustering Connectivity-Based Clustering Gaussian-Mixture Clustering Density-Based Clustering These are introduced in the YouTube video (left) and explained in further detail in the References.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/shallow-networks.html"}

A major limitation of fast (turbo) spin echo sequences is excessive heating of tissues. This is a direct consequence of the high concentration of 180-pulses intrinsic to their design. Energy deposition from an RF-pulse is proportional to the square of the flip angle (  ). Thus, a 180-pulse deposits 4x the energy of a 90-pulse. By reducing the RF-flip angles from 180 to the 50150 range, thermal energy deposition can be significantly reduced. But wouldn't these smaller flip angles also reduce the MR signal? The answer is yes, but not as much as you might imagine. When RF-flip angles are reduced below 180, the magnetization at each echo is no longer refocused purely into the transverse plane. A considerable portion of the magnetization is \"stored\" along the longitudinal direction and regrows via T1-relaxation mechanisms. Each successive non-180-pulse in the train continues to split the magnetization into more longitudinal and transverse components. Stimulated echoes from these stored longitudinal components make progressively larger contributions to the MR signal, which now depends on both T1 and T2. It is these stimulated echoes, acting along multiple extra coherence pathways, that allow a higher than expected signal to be obtained when flip angle is reduced. For a set of refocusing pulses all with the same flip angle  <180, the system initially oscillates but reaches a pseudo-steady state (PSS) of transverse magnetization that reduced in amplitude by a factor of approximately sin( /2 ) compared to an all 180-sequence. So, for example, if 100 instead of 180-pulses were used, the FSE signal would be reduced to sin(50)  77% of its maximum value. Once established, the level of the PSS can be increased by varying flip angle along the course of the FSE echo train. This technique is known by the acronym TRAPS (TRansition between Pseudo-steady States) and is illustrated below. Three variations of reduced flip angle FSE imaging. In the first case, constant 100 RF-pulses are used resulting in a pseudo-steady stateafter a few oscillations. In the second variation a transition between pseudo-steady states is achieved by increasing the flip angle to 120 halfway through the sequence. The third variation begins with preparatory pulses followed by ramped flip angles. The resultant theoretical signal intensities are shown below (ignoring T1 and T2 effects). Several additional modifications to the reduced flip angle approach allow for even higher average signals and reduced energy deposition. The initial level of the PSS can be significantly increased by beginning the sequence with a set of 5-10 preparatory or \"start-up\" pulses to catalyze the process. Another modification is to linearly or sinusoidally ramp the flip angles from low to high values along the echo train. When the lowest flip angles are used early in the train, a very high fraction (~80%) of magnetization remains stored along the longitudinal axis. This stored magnetization can then be \"drawn upon\" to permit the generation of stronger signals later in the echo train. The largest flip angles are applied at the time of the lowest order phase encode steps, since these determine over MR signal and basic image contrast. A third modification is to use symmetric hyperechoes , the subject of the next Q&A .", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/reduced-flip-angle-fse.html"}

In routine MR imaging, the mild T2-shortening effects of low doses of gadolinium (which decrease signal intensity) are usually overwhelmed by the more dominant T1-shortening effects (which increase signal intensity) and are therefore not normally observed. However, as the concentration of Gd increases, signal intensity will eventually begin to fall. The Gd concentration beyond which signal falls depends on the particular tissue and pulse sequence parameters selected. Paradoxically decreased signal intensity of some tumors postcontrast has been reported, but this is a rare phenomenon and is not normally encountered on routine MR images of most tissues using standard doses of gadolinium. In the kidneys and bladder, however, where Gd is excreted and concentrated, tissue and urine levels of Gd may approach 40 mM. At concentrations this high, T2 shortening may result in a significant decrease in signal intensity noticeable on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Urine in the bladder may exhibit an unusual triple-layering phenomenon . T2-shortening effects predominate and a low signal occurs in the bottom pseudolayer where Gd concentration is highest. In the middle layer, moderate concentrations of Gd result in T1 shortening and high MR signal. \"Pseudolayering\" of gadolinium contrast in the urinary bladder as a result of differential concentration. Low-T2 signal may occasionally be seen in MR arthrograms and venograms (where high concentrations of gadolinium are injected directly into joints or vessels); and in the \"first pass\" of gadolinium contrast through the vascular system on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) studies or time-resolved MR angiography.

Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) comprises a group of largely experimental methods by which the absolute concentrations of iron, calcium and other substances may be measured in tissues based on changes in local susceptibility. The acquisition sequence for QSM is typically a 3D GRE similar to that used for routine SWI, but multiple echoes are used to allow for detection of weak susceptibility changes and correction for multi-exponential T2*-decay. On our Siemens 3.0T scanner we use 6 echoes at TE's ranging from 10-44 ms with flow compensation in the readout direction. Simple calculation of total phase shifts in an area is inadequate to produce accurate QS maps. Local susceptibility effects are highly dependent on the shape and orientation of the objects producing those shifts. For example, the phase (or frequency) change induced by a cylindrical structure (like a vein) has a sin  dependence on its direction relative to the main magnetic field. In theory for vessels running exactly parallel to the main field no phase shift should be observed though they contain paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin; maximal phase shift will occur when they run perpendicular to the field (i.e., in plane for axial images). Another problem concerns QSM for regions containing both diamagnetic (calcium) and paramagnetic (iron) components. This is seen commonly in the basal ganglia as well as in certain vascular malformations and tumors. In this situation the positive and negative phase shifts may cancel each other out so that it may appear neither is present in a voxel. QSM of iron stores in the basal ganglia (from Acosta-Cabronero et al under CC BY) Several models have been developed to analyze QSM data. Most are based on the concept that a small focus of paramagnetic or diamagnetic material can be represented as a magnetic dipole interacting with that material to create a local susceptibility field disturbance B . These local field disturbances are normally swamped by much larger background field changes which must be removed. One of the currently popular methods for background field removal is called Projection onto Dipole Fields (PDF) . After suitable background removal, an extraordinarily difficult mathematical inverse problem exists to calculate the individual dipole sources giving rise to the sum of these local field disturbances. Here, the Morphology Enabled Dipole Inversion Method (MEDI) is among the most commonly used.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/quantitative-susceptibility.html"}

A variety of T1-weighted pulse sequences are available for postcontrast imaging. These include conventional spin echo (SE), fast (turbo) spin echo (FSE), T1-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (T1-FLAIR), spoiled gradient echo (SPGR), and magnetization prepared gradient echo (MP-RAGE) methods. All provide T1-weighted contrast and are effective at showing regions of T1 shortening due to gadolinium accumulation. Recall the important concept from a previous Q&A  that \"T1-weighted\" images are not \"T1-maps.\" All T1-weighted images contain signal contributions not only from T1, but from proton density, T2, chemical shift, flow, and susceptibility effects. And each class of pulse sequences (SE, GRE, IR, etc) admix these non-contributions in different ways. Accordingly, no single \"best\" gadolinium pulse sequence exists for all lesions in all locations. Considerable research has been directed to brain metastasis, however, where the conspicuity of larger lesions seems to follow the favored order T1-FLAIR > T1-SE > T1-GRE. An example is shown below. 2D T1-FLAIR 2D T1-weighted SE 3D SPGR However, T1-GRE sequences can be easily acquired in thin-section (1-2 mm) 3D mode.

In fact, for brain metastases at our institution, we use all three sequences. For body imaging applications, the dominant considerations for optimal post-contrast pulse sequence depend on the presence of fat (which requires suppression) and motion (that must be reduced or eliminated).

{"id": "7c2322c3-3abe-42d9-8b64-5319c18b3680", "contents": "Gradient Echo (GRE) What is a gradient echo, and how does it differ from an FID? In the previous Q&A we discussed the free induction decay (FID) signal that can be observed immediately after RF excitation is complete. The FID has an underlying frequency of a sine wave oscillating at the Larmor frequency damped by exponential decay with time constant T2* (\"T2-star\") . T2* reflects the effects of true T2 due to molecular mechanisms as well as phase dispersion due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. A gradient echo (GRE) is simply a clever manipulation of the FID signal that begins by applying an external dephasing gradient field across the specimen or tissue. This gradient (produced by special coils hidden within the magnet housing) causes a calibrated change in local magnetic fields and hence alters the resonance frequencies slightly across the specimen. This results in accelerated dephasing and 'squelching/ scrambling' of the FID. In step 2, the process is reversed. A rephasing gradient is applied with the same strength but opposite polarity to the dephasing gradient, reversing/ undoing the phase scramble. A small GRE has been generated! Note that the rephasing gradient has only refocused spins scrambled by the dephasing gradient itself . T2 and T2* processes are unaffected. First step in GRE formation. A gradient is applied across the specimen, resulting in accelerated dephasing and squelching of the FID. Second step in GRE formation. A rephasing gradient is applied (opposite in polarity to the dephasing gradient). This reverses the phase shifts induced by the dephasing gradient and resurrects the FID as GRE. Note that T2* decay continues unabated. The illustrations on this page serve as our first introduction to the MR pulse-timing diagram. This is a graphical representation of when RF-pulses are applied, MR signals are generated, and gradients are turned on and off. Time is on the horizontal axis. Here the gradients are shown in green as rectangular \"lobes\". An upwardly projecting lobe means the gradient is turned on with positive polarity; a downward lobe means the gradient in turned on in the opposite direction. The height of the rectangle is proportional to the strength of the applied gradient and hence the spread of frequencies it induces. The width of each rectangle is the time that the gradient is applied . The area under each gradient lobe therefore reflects (frequency x time) and hence the net phase accumulated by spins in due to the gradient alone. Pulse timing diagram for a GRE signal generation showing () and (+) gradient lobes that dephase and rephase spins respectively. The lowest line shows the phase changes of four spins in different spatial locations subjected to the () and (+) gradients. The peak of the gradient echo occurs when the net phase shift among spins is zero. Note that in our diagram the upward gradient has been left on twice as long as the dephase gradient. This is the optimal design when the gradient is used for frequency-encoding purposes, but is not strictly necessary as a GRE will form after only one (+) lobe. The lower portion of this diagram shows the phases of four spins subjected to dephase and rephase gradients. The peak echo occurs when the net phase shift among spins is zero, which happens when the (+) area under the rephase gradient matches the () area under the dephase gradient. The rephasing of spins by gradient reversal is often illustrated by analogy to runners on a track, such as the tortoise and hare shown right. The fast hare represents spins precessing rapidly (and accumulating phase) by virtue of their location in a stronger portion of the gradient; the tortoise represents more slowly precessing spins in a weaker part of the gradient. The fast hare travels much farther initially (corresponding to a larger phase accumulation). The reversal of direction half way through the race corresponds to the gradients being applied with opposite polarities (rephase lobes). The hare again runs faster but in the opposite direction, having more distance to make up. Finally both return to the starting line at the same time (equivalent to net phase shift = 0).

A number of semi-quantitative perfusion parameters can be obtained by analysis of DSC signal intensity curves for each voxel during passage of the contrast bolus. These parameters are easy to calculate and hence are widely used. However, they lack precision and consistency, being highly dependent on the efficiency/compactness of the contrast bolus. The absolute values of these parameters have little meaning by themselves, but can be helpful in a relative sense (such as comparing corresponding regions on two sides of the brain). The most common of these so-called \"summary\" parameters are illustrated and defined below. Simplified semiquantitative analysis of DSC signal intensity curves Arrival Time (AT, t o ) is the interval between intravenous contrast injection and its first detection in tissue (or in a large feeding artery). Because MR signals vary randomly due to noise and motion, a dozen or more time points must be averaged prior to contrast arrival to establish a baseline . An arbitrary detection threshold is then set (e.g., 5% below baseline) to define contrast arrival. Alternatively, this threshold may be set manually by visual inspection of the signal intensity curve. However calculated, AT reflects the sum of all processes leading to tissue delivery of contrast (injection rate, cardiac output, region blood flow, etc). Significantly different arrival times of contrast to the two sides of the brain, for example, might reflect unilateral carotid artery stenosis. Time to Peak (TTP) is typically defined as the time from initial contrast injection to peak (maximal) signal loss within the organ of interest. TTP has the same uses and limitations as AT but is superior because the peak is easily identified without need to set an arbitrary detection threshold for first arrival. In some software applications, TTP does not include the arrival time, being defined as the interval between first detection of contrast ( t o ) and peak signal loss. Negative Enhancement Integral (NEI) is the total area (\"integral\") under the signal intensity curve during first pass of gadolinium, sometime known by its synonym, Area Under Curve (AUC) . NEI reflects the total amount of contrast transiting through the regional vascular system and is roughly proportional to blood volume. Because of recirculation effects explained in the prior Q&A , the baseline does not return to normal at the end of the first pass. An arbitrary decision must then be to made as to define the right hand limit of integration as well as how to handle the shifting baseline. Often mathematical models of the signal intensity curve (such as the gamma variate function ) are used to correct for recirculation and baseline shift effects and make NEI calculations more consistent. Mean Time to Enhance (MTE) represents the average time for the entire bolus of injected contrast to pass through a region of tissue. Absolute values of MTE are therefore highly dependent on the shape (compactness) of the arriving contrast bolus and to a lesser degree on tissue perfusion. Although frequently confused, it is important to recognize that MTE is not the same as Mean Transit Time (MTT) , which reflects the average time for a single contrast molecule (not the entire bolus) to pass through tissue. In simulations, MTE can be up to 3x longer than true MTT . The uncertainty is compounded in that vendors have slightly different names and methods for computing MTE, including calculating the first moment (centroid) of the NEI or using its full width at half maximum (FWHM). Some software applications also provide a simplified estimate of relative blood flow (rBF) from this data, calculated as NEI/MTE. Although an analog for true blood flow ( BF = BV/MTT ), the limitations and errors in this approach are readily apparent. Percent Baseline at Peak (PBP) and Percent Signal Recovery (PSR) are defined respectively as the ratios of signal intensity at minimum (peak) or during the recirculation phase (recovery) divided by their initial (baseline) values. Easy to calculate but these parameters reflect a mixture of experimental and physiological phenomena, so are infrequently used. Time-to-peak (TTP, left) and negative enhancement integral (NEI, right) maps generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis directly from first-pass signal intensity curves in a DSC study. Although their absolute values are meaningless, they are easy to calculate and may be useful in a relative sense to compare perfusion in corresponding brain regions. To derive more quantifiable maps such as blood flow and blood volume more sophisticated mathematical processing is required.

Double inversion recovery (DIR) is a type of \"black blood\" technique useful for visualizing the walls of the cardiac chambers and blood vessels (including the coronary arteries). As the name implies, the sequence involves application of two RF-inversion pulses in close succession after an EKG trigger. The first inverting pulse is spatially non-selective , while the second pulse is spatially selective . Dark blood double IR sequence. After the two inversion pulses, tissue within a slice is unaffected, but the magnetization of blood outside the slice is inverted. As this blood flows into the slice for imaging, it produces no signal since TI is chosen to be null its signal. The image acquisition module is typically 2D fast (turbo) spin echo. The term nonselective means that the first 180-pulse inverts all spins within the entire active volume of the transmit coil. The second 180-pulse is spatially selective , meaning that its effects are restricted to the single slice being imaged. The second RF-pulse thus restores longitudinal magnetization for both blood and myocardium within the imaging slice. For spins outside the slice, however, the longitudinal magnetization remains inverted. Over the next several hundred msec, two events occur simultaneously: 1) inverted blood initially outside the imaged slice undergoes T1-recovery of its longitudinal magnetization, passing through zero as it attempts to realign with B o ; and 2) this outside blood flows into and replaces blood within the imaged slice. The inversion time (TI) is chosen so that the magnetization of this inflowing blood passes through zero at the start of image acquisition. For cardiac imaging at 1.5T with a heart rate of 60 BPM, this typically means a TI null of approximately 650 msec. If the HR is too fast, TI must be reduced. Some systems do this automatically using a software-based blood suppression TI calculation. The most commonly used imaging sequence in conjunction with this double IR method is fast (turbo) spin echo with a relatively short TE eff ( 40 msec). Alternatively, a segmented k-space gradient echo or echo-planar sequence may also be used. Short-axis double IR image of heart Long-axis double IR image of heart Limitations of the DIR technique include prolonged imaging times and sequence-specific artifacts. First relatively long inversion times are necessary especially at slower heart rates to achieve sufficient nulling of blood. These long TI values may conflict with optimal trigger delay, forcing adoption of a suboptimal imaging protocol. With long TI's a repetition time ( TR ) of two heart beats may be required for effective blood suppression. The end result is that imaging of a single coronary artery might take in excess of 10 minutes to image using the DIR method. Blood suppression may also be compromised if the plane of imaging is not perpendicular to the direction of flow. This is illustrated the image (right) where signal in the cardiac chambers is well-suppressed but that in the descending aorta (red arrow) is not. Here flow in the aorta lies within the plane of imaging, and aortic blood is is not completely replenished between the two inversion pulses. A similar phenomenon may occur in tortuous or slowly-flowing arteries. Sometimes an artifactual high-intensity band may appear along the periphery of an artery due to slow laminar flow at the boundary between the vessel wall and its lumen.

The simplest model of regional circulation contains a single arterial input, a tissue capillary bed, and a single venous output. This model has a long history, originally used by Fick in the 19th Century to study cardiac output. Later modifications for indicator dilution blood flow measurements were made by Kety and Schmidt in the 1940s and extended by Meier and Zierler in the 1950's. Simple model of regional circulation with a single arterial input and single venous output. Blood flow ( BF ) and Blood Volume ( BV ) are assumed to be constant. Blood flow (BF) through the system and blood volume (BV) within the tissue are both assumed to be constant. The units for BF and BV are usually normalized by dividing their absolute values by the mass of tissue perfused, resulting in units of the form mL/min/100g and mL/100g respectively. No pooling or loss of blood is allowed, so that whatever flows in eventually flows out. Note that some paths through the tissue are relatively straight while others are highly branched. This means that each red blood cell or contrast agent molecule takes a different amount of time to traverse the capillary bed (although all will eventually appear in the venous efflux). The mean transit time (MTT), measured in sec (or min), reflects the average time an injected tracer particle following the flow of blood would reside within the system. Blood flow ( BF ), blood volume ( BV ), and mean transit time ( MTT ) are related by the central volume theorem , so that if two are known, the third can be computed. The connecting relationship is given by the equation BF = BV / MTT which can be easily remembered by considering units of measurement, i.e., that blood flow represents a volume of blood per unit time. In perfusion imaging studies, BF , BV , and MTT are commonly calculated and displayed as color-coded parameter maps. These provide complementary perfusion-related information that may be useful for clinical decision making. For example, areas of cerebral infarction typically display decreased BV and BF , with increased MTT . Conversely, areas of ischemia without infarction (the 'penumbra') typically have reduced BF and increased MTT , but normal BV .

What about pregnant techs and staff? Overall Risks As detailed in another Q&A , there is no convincing evidence that significant long-term biological effects exist for the types of electromagnetic field exposures a staff member would be expected to have in and around an MRI scanner. The typical MRI worker is not commonly in the magnet room during scanning; therefore she is only occasionally exposed to gradient or radiofrequency fields. The main occupational exposure is from being around the static ( B o ) fringe field intermittently for most of the day. With self-shielded scanners, the peak static field exposure for staff is unlikely to exceed 50% of B o , and the average exposure over a shift would be only a few mT. For MR staff working around scanners with field strengths of 3T or higher, however, short term sensory effects (including nausea and dizziness) have been clearly demonstrated. For example, the incidence of vertigo among staff working at 1.5T, 3.0T, and 7.0T has been reported to be about 4%, 8%, and 24% respectively. These effects can be mitigated by moving slowly around the scanner or at the scanner bore to minimize dB/dt in the fringe field. Regulatory Limits There is no shortage of regulatory organizations that have developed and promulgated standards for occupational magnetic field exposures, although most are not binding around the world. The most important organizations include the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 2013, the European Council published Directive 2013/35/EU, a sweeping revision of prior regulations on occupational electromagnetic field exposure by which European Union member states are now bound. The EU Directive for the most part mirrors the exposure limits set by the ICNIRP in 2010, but have exceptions for special clinical, research, or engineering situations. The existing panoply of regulations is confusing and in some cases contradictory. For example, the occupational body static field limit is set at 8T by the IEC, but only 2T by the ICNIRP. For occupational RF exposures, the current limits are 4 W/kg for the IEC, but only 0.4 W/kg for both the ICNIRP and IEEE. The excellent reviews by McRobbie (2012) and Mazar (2016) nicely catalog various occupational limits in various countries and their rationales. Special Considerations for Pregnant Staff In 1993 Kanal et al reviewed medical history questionnaires from over 1400 pregnant MRI technologists, nurses and health care workers. They found no statistically significant difference between the rates of spontaneous abortions/miscarriages, or low birth weights, or premature delivery, or infertility, or male offspring between those working as MR employees versus the same population when they were employed elsewhere. Although there is no definitive evidence that occupational exposure to MR-level magnetic fields may be harmful to a pregnant staff member or her fetus, we have adopted a conservative approach and try to limit exposure throughout pregnancy. We try to keep pregnant personnel out of the scanner rooms especially while scanning is occurring. This practice minimizes their exposure to the higher level of static magnetic fields and eliminates completely their exposure to the time-varying (RF) fields. Being outside the room during scanning also nullifies concerns about acoustic noise on the fetus. If a staff member has strong fears about her occupational exposure during pregnancy, we assign her a clerical position far away from the scanner (a job we refer to as \"tech-retary\"). Fortunately, there are also other jobs in the MR suite, such as patient preparation and counseling, image archiving and filming, with little or no magnetic field exposure.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/personnel-exposure.html"}

Susceptibility-weighted images (SWI) are generated from gradient-echo (GRE) pulse sequences. GRE sequences are sensitive to differences in tissue susceptibility because they lack the ability to refocus spins dephased by magnetic field inhomogeneities. Although simple T2*-weighted GRE sequences have traditionally been used for the detection of iron/blood products and calcifications , modern SWI sequences incorporate several features and enhancements making them superior. SWI sequences are typically acquired in 3D (rather than 2D) mode, allowing thinner slices and smaller voxel sizes to be obtained. Flow compensation in all three directions is used to reduce artifacts and parallel imaging is employed to reduce imaging time. Either single or multiple echoes may be acquired in a given TR interval. A key feature of SWI is that magnitude and phase information are independently processed/displayed as well as combined for diagnostic purposes. Typical imaging parameters include TR = 25-50 ms, TE = 20-40 ms, and flip angles = 15-20. Shorter times and smaller flip angles are used as field strength increases. The precise methods employed by major MR vendors differ and are proprietary, but are largely based on strategies similar to those first described by Haacke et al (2004) and illustrated below. Using quadrature detection, both magnitude and phase data are separately reconstructed. The magnitude image is saved for diagnostic purposes, displaying background tissue with spin-density-like contrast. Phase data must undergo further processing to be clinically useful, however. The raw phase image is dominated by large but slowly changing \"macro\"-susceptibility gradients due to generalized field inhomogeneities as well as distortions due to air and bone at the skull base. Digital high-pass filtering can be used to remove these low-frequency fluctuations, and additional local phase correction algorithms may be employed to reduce artifacts at the skull base. The end result is a filtered phase image that is saved and used for diagnostic purposes, as described in the following Q&A . A phase mask is next created that scales data from the filtered phase images over a 0-1 range to accentuate tissues with different susceptibilities. The magnitude image is digitally multiplied by this phase mask several times until the desired mix of phase information is imparted (denoted by the exponent \" n\" in the diagram below). In practice, n = 4 complex multiplications are typically performed. The end result is a susceptibility-weighted (SW) image , which simultaneously contains both magnitude and phase information and is used for clinical diagnosis. Minimum intensity projections (mIPs) of the SW image are typically displayed, which vary in thickness depending on how many of the original 3D source images are stacked together. All major MR vendors offer susceptibility-based sequences under their own trade names. Siemens calls theirs simply SWI and uses a method most akin to Haacke's.

Eovist (sold as Primovist outside the USA) is a relatively new gadolinium-based MR contrast agent manufactured by Bayer HealthCare designed for liver imaging. The chemical structure of the molecule closely resembles Gd-DTPA, but with one arm of the ligand attached to the highly lipophylic ethoxybenzyl (EOB) group accounting for liver uptake. The abbreviated generic chemical name for the agent is gadoxetic acid . Gd-DTPA-EOB (Eovist). The right side of the molecule is similar to Gd-DTPA (Magnevist) with the additional phenolic side chain (upper left) which allows uptake by hepatocytes. After intravenous injection the drug initially distributes into the vascular and extracellular spaces in a manner similar to other gadolinium agents. Shortly thereafter up to half of the administered dose progressively accumulates in hepatocytes and then is excreted into the biliary tract. The remainder is excreted by the kidneys through glomerular filtration. Eovist thus has double distribution and elimination pathways, allowing it to be used to assess both vascularity and function of liver lesions. The approved dose of Eovist is 0.025 mmol/kg body weight, typically injected at a rate of 1-2 mL/min followed by a saline bolus. Breath-hold imaging is performed with a rapid 3D T1-weighted gradient echo sequence such as LAVA, VIBE, or CAIPIRINA using parallel imaging acceleration. At least three sets of dynamic breath-hold images are usually acquired: 1) a late arterial phase at approximately 15 seconds after contrast arrives in the abdominal aorta; 2) a portal venous phase 15-30 seconds later; and 3) a late dynamic phase 2-3 minutes thereafter. Finally, a fourth set of images in the hepatobiliary phase is acquired 15-20 minutes after injection (in patients with normal hepatic function). Hepatic enhancement generally persists for at least 2 hours following injection allowing a relatively large window for imaging. Eovist. Late arterial phase shows hypervascular metastasis in right lobe of liver. Note enhancement of aorta and spleen. Eovist. Hepatocyte phase shows no uptake in this metastatic lesion (arrow). In addition to being taken up by functioning normal hepatocytes, uptake by hyperplastic hepatocytes (as in focal nodular hyperplasia) resulting in hyperintensity during the hepatobiliary phase can occur. Uptake of gadoxetic acid may also be seen in certain types of hepatocellular adenoma (-cateninactivated type, inflammatory type) and hepatocellular carcinoma (so-called \"green hepatomas\"). Extracellular and peritumoral accumulation can cause hyperintensity in hemangiomas, fibrotic tumors, GISTs, HCCs, and neuroendocrine tumors. An adverse reaction to Eovist apparently unique to this agent is \"transient dyspnea\", occurring in about 10% of patients. This is dose-related and more frequent in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is manifest by significantly increased motion artifacts during the T1-weighted arterial phase of imaging. In the liver Eovist competes with bilirubin for active transport into hepatocytes utilizing the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 ( OATP1 ) system. If bilirubin levels are elevated, hepatic parenchymal enhancement will be decreased and delayed. Excretion into the biliary tract is accomplished via the canalicular multispecific organic anion transport ( cMOAT ) system. Eovist will therefore compete with other drugs that share this mechanism (e.g., cisplatin, tamoxifen, methotrexate).

Certain trade-offs exist in the selection of parameters for a time-of-flight MRA sequence. Although the final parameters will likely be determined empirically, the reader should be aware of the following compromises when selecting TR , TE, and flip angle (  ). Relationship between TR , slice thickness ( d ), and flow velocity ( V ) . Maximum flow-related enhancement occurs when inflowing blood completely replaces that present in a given slice. When flow is perpendicular to the slice, maximum enhancement occurs when V  d / TR For example, with V = 50 cm/sec and TR = 40 ms (0.04 sec), blood is completely replaced as long as the slice thickness ( d )  2.0 cm. Maximum flow-related enhancement is related to velocity ( V ), slice thickness ( d ), and repetition time ( T ) Accordingly, flow-related (TOF) enhancement is maximized for perpendicular flow, thin slices, long TR, and high velocities. Effect of TR . Increasing TR allows more time for T1 relaxation processes to occur between pulses. Although greater inflow enhancement may be possible, increasing TR is often undesirable because the signal from background tissue also increases, with loss of vessel conspicuity. Moreover, increasing TR also lengthens scan time. Typical TR values are generally in the range of 15-35 ms for both 2D and 3D TOF MRA at high field. Effect of flip angle (  ) . Increasing flip angle decreases signal from static tissue due to greater saturation and increases relative signal from blood at the entry slice. For rapidly flowing vessels, increasing flip angle will lead to more background suppression with improved conspicuity of vessels. For slowly flowing vessels, however, the flip angle may need to be reduced. Depending on the application, flip angles from 30 to 70 are commonly employed for 2D TOF and 10 to 30 for 3D TOF. Effect of TE . Increasing TE will increase the signal from vessels, but this theoretical benefit is offset by signal loss due to spin-phase dispersion at long TE values. Generally, TE is selected to be the minimum allowable for a given pulse sequence. On modern scanners, this usually translates to TE's on the order of 3-7 ms. Gradient-moment nulling can be used to overcome some of these spin-phase losses, but this will increase the minimum TE slightly. Within these limits, selecting a value of TE close to a fat-water out-of-phase value (e.g. 2.2, 4.4 or 6.6 msec at 1.5T) may be useful for improving background suppression.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/mra-parameters.html"}

Wrap-around and other types of aliasing artifacts do occur in radial/spiral methods, but they have forms different than those seen on rectilinear (Cartesian) scanning. In most radial and spiral imaging methods, frequency- and phase-axes do not maintain fixed relationships to the cardinal anatomic directions (left-right, superior-inferior, etc.) Instead, phase- and frequency-encoding directions change continually as the trajectory sweeps or rotates around the center of k -space. When aliasing occurs, it usually takes the form of curvilinear bands diffusely distributed across the image, although discrete radially arranged \"ghosts\" may also appear. PROPELLER acquisition shows how frequency- and phase-encoding directions change depending on orientation of each blade. Aliasing from red point (lower left) outside the circular FOV is replicated as an arc across the image. When relatively a few blades and small FOV are used, several discrete aliased images from back of head are noted When many blades are used, the aliasing artifacts become more widely dispersed. A somewhat different form of artifact is commonly seen in the background of PROPELLER images consisting of a diffuse \"halo\" of fine lines or streaks. These are reconstruction artifacts resulting from gridding , the process where data points acquired in radial/spiral mode must morphed/interpolated to fit into an evenly spaced rectangular array for data processing. With linear interpolation, simple shading occurs across the image, but with higher order interpolation schemes more complex oscillations are aliased into the image. Occasionally these may resemble bright streaks from the edges of high signal objects, similar to those seen around bone or metal on CT.

At present, seven Gd-based contrast agents are commercially marketed and available in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Their brand names and general chemical characteristics are listed in the table below. Except for Eovist (gadoxetate) having high (~50%) liver uptake, all are non-specific agents that distribute principally in the extracellular interstitial space. Note that in 2017 the use of some of these linear agents was suspended or restricted in the European Union (EU) due to concerns about potential free gadolinium toxicity. Additionally that year, production and distribution of two agents (Ablavar and OptiMark) were voluntarily terminated by their manufacturers and have been removed from previous versions of the table. The ionic radius of Gd +3 (108 pm) is very close to that of Ca +2 (114 pm). Free gadolinium is therefore a competitive inhibitor of physiologic processes that depend on Ca +2 influx, including voltage-gated calcium channels and the activity of some enzymes. All Gd-based MR contrast agents therefore use some sort of ligand to chelate (contain) the free ion and reduce its high toxicity. Structurally, gadolinium-containing contrast agents can be divided into two groups based on the type of ligand. Linear agents have an elongated organic molecular ligand that wraps around the ion. Macrocyclic agents form a cage-like ligand structure with the ion trapped in a preformed central cavity. Both linear and macrocyclic agents can either be ionic or non-ionic.

Is this safe? Is this legal? None of the eight commercially available gadolinium-based contrast agents have been approved for intra-articular or intrathecal administration in the United States or in most other countries. Nevertheless, regulatory government agencies in most countries permit the discretionary use of approved drugs for non-approved purposes. This is known as \" off-label use \" of a pharmaceutical agent. In the United States, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves drugs shown to be safe and effective for certain clinical conditions, but does not control or limit how those drugs are prescribed once available on the market. As such a US physician may administer an approved MR contrast agent at a different dose or by different route (intra-articular or intrathecal) in particular clinical situations where a benefit to the patient may accrue. Intra-articular injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents is widely and commonly performed at most larger MR centers around the world. Known as gadolinium-enhanced MR arthrography, this technique has been proved valuable in demonstrating small tears in cartilage and ligaments not visible on routine MRI. Intra-articular injection of Gd-DTPA into the wrist The contrast must be highly diluted with saline prior to injection, with levels of approximately 2 mmol/L recommended for most joints. (By comparison, the concentration of most undiluted Gd contrast agents is 0.5 M = 500 mmol/L . In a number of European countries, an option is to use Artirem, a version of gadoterate prediluted 100-fold and marketed by Guerbet for intra-articular use). Depending on the size of the joint, between 10 and 40 mL are typically injected. A small amount of iodinated contrast is frequently mixed in so that the injection can be followed under x-ray fluoroscopy. If the gadolinium contrast is not diluted, a signal drop-out will occur due to T2-shortening effects. Animal studies have confirmed that the gadolinium contrast is rapidly reabsorbed after injection with no acute or long-term injury to the synovial structures. Although Gd does not appear to cause any direct toxicity or inflammation, about 2/3 of patients will experience significant joint pain developing within the first 2 days after injection. The nature of this discomfort is unclear, but probably not due to the gadolinium. It may be caused by joint distention by the injected saline or the iodine agent (the latter known to cause synovitis and pain in CT arthrography). Intrathecal injection of gadolinium has been advocated for the evaluation of patients with suspected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks, and appears to be more sensitive than CT myelography for this purpose. Typically about 0.3-0.5 mL of a 0.5 M gadolinium contrast (e.g., Gd-DTPA) is injected into the subarachnoid space via lumbar puncture. Higher doses will more likely result in very severe headaches and nausea. To insure even distribution, this may be diluted in 4-5 cc of saline, an iodine myelographic contrast agent like iohexol, or the patient's own cerebrospinal fluid prior to injection. Fat suppressed T1-weighted images of the spine or skull base are then obtained after a 15 minute delay. Intrathecal gadolinium in these low doses seems well-tolerated in the limited clinical series reported to date except for headaches. However, in doses higher than 0.1 mmol, seizures, transient hemiparesis, encephalopathy, and death have been reported. The absolute safety of intrathecal gadolinium is less well established than intra-articular gadolinium, so at present I believe should be only considered in selected patients believed symptomatic from occult CSF leakage.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/intra-articularthecal-gd.html"}

A metallic object may experience two types of forces when placed in an external magnetic field: translation and rotation. Translational force is that which pulls the object toward the magnet, while rotational force (also known as torque ) is that which seeks to align the long axis of the object with the lines of the magnetic field. Translational ( F trans ) and rotational ( F rot ) forces on a magnetizable object placed in an external magnetic field ( B o ) The Ellipsoidal Model Predicting the effects of a magnetic field on irregularly-shaped objects generally requires computer simulation, so most analytical equations for force and torque are based on simple geometric forms having exact mathematical solutions. The most popular of these (used in equations below) is the magnetically homogeneous ellipsoid of revolution . By varying length ( a ), diameter ( d ), and angulation (  ) of the ellipsoid's axis of symmetry with respect to B , a wide range of representative objects in different orientations (e.g. spheres, footballs, pancakes, rods/needles) can be created and analyzed. Additional complexity exists for objects made of metals that are moderately to strongly ferromagnetic as the externally applied field increases. Demagnetizing fields must be considered, as such objects begin to act like little magnets. These are described by directionally-specific demagnetizing factors , which for ellipsoids are denoted N a and N d . Magnetic saturation may occur, meaning the object's internal magnetization will plateau when it exceeds a certain critical value ( B sat ). Permanent magnetization of the object ( at value B rem ) may occur, even when the external field is removed. General Equations for Force and Torque on an Ellipsoid Equations for force ( F z ) and torque ( T ) on an ellipsoid have the general forms below: Translational force ( F z ) in the z -direction (parallel to B ), where Torque ( T ) on an object immersed in a magnetic field ( B ), where Here f() and g() are functions that depend on the object's intrinsic susceptibility (  ), shape-dependent demagnetizing factors ( N a and N d ), and angle the object makes with the external magnetic field (  ). The term  o  4 x 10 7 N/A is the magnetic constant , also known as the permeability of free space. For objects other than ellipsoids, the form of f() and g() will vary, but several common features should be noted: Both F z and T scale directly with volume (Vol) , so doubling the size on an object doubles the force or torque upon it. F z is proportional to B, while T is proportional to B . So doubling the local field doubles the translational force but quadruples the torque on an object. Translational force is strongest near the edges of the magnet opening and zero in the center of the bore . Translational force is proportional to the local field (B) multiplied by its spatial rate of change (dB/dz), a combined entity known as the spatial gradient product (SGP) . The SGP is strongest near the edges of the magnet bore opening, making this the most powerful place for translational forces. At the magnet isocenter, however, dB/dz  0, so surprisingly there is no translational force once the object reaches the center of the magnet. In the center of the bore, torque is extremely powerful while translational force is zero. This is because B is (nearly) maximal here while dB/dz is negligible. Torque is maximal at 45  and minimal at 0  . As seen in the expression for g( ) , torque has an angular dependence ( sin 2 ), being maximal when the object is at 45 to B and lowest when the object is parallel to B (corresponding to sin 90 = 1 and sin 0  = 0 ). For strongly ferromagnetic objects, dependence on  disappears and demagnetizing factors ( N i ) become important. Special Cases for Force and Torque Paramagnetic and Weakly Ferromagnetic Metals Materials (such as most surgical stainless steels, copper, and lead) that have small magnetic susceptibilities (  < 1 ) experience only trivial forces compared to gravity when placed in an external field. Demagnetizing fields and factors are insignificant, so the equations simplify to: Translational force ( F z ) in the z -direction for an object with small magnetic susceptibility (  < 1 ) Torque ( T ) of an elongated object with small magnetic susceptibility (  < 1 ) making an angle  with B Unsaturated Moderately and Stongly Ferromagnetic Metals For such materials with high susceptibilities (  >> 1 ), explicit dependence on the value of  disappears and demagnetization factors become important. N a and N d values for ellipsoids can be direcly calculated or obtained from tables. The equations for translational force and torque become Translational force ( F z ) in the z -direction for an unsaturated ferromagnetic ellipsoid (with  >> 1 ) Torque ( T ) of an unsaturated ferromagnetic ellipsoid (with >>1 ) making angle (  ) with the main magnetic field Saturated Ferromagnetic Metals As the ambient external field ( B ) increases, magnetic saturation of the object may occur, as described in a prior Q&A . The internal field where saturation occurs ( B sat ) is material-specific, and lying in the range of 0.5-2.0 T for common commercial alloys. Taking demagnetizing fields into account, magnetic saturation occurs whenever an object is brought close enough to the scanner such that the fringe field exceeds N  B sat , where N is the demagnetizing factor. Thus for a spherical object (with N =) made of nickel (with B sat = 0.62T), saturation will occur whenever the external magnetic field exceeds ( )(0.62) = 0.21T. The force and torque equations are similar to the unsaturated case, with B replaced by B sat . Translational force ( F z ) in the z -direction for a fully saturated ferromagnetic ellipsoid (with  >> 1 ) Torque ( T ) of a fully saturated ferromagnetic ellipsoid (with >>1 ) making angle (  ) with the main magnetic field Interestingly, as long as the external field is sufficient to saturate the object, both the force and torque become independent of B and the force depends only on the field spatial gradient ( dB/dz ). Permanent Magnets In some cases an object that has been permanently magnetized (to value B rem ) previously is reintroduced into the external field. Clinical examples include patients with cochlear implants and dental magnetic keepers. The actual force and torque may be difficult to predict and depend on the hysteresis characteristics of the magnet material. In some cases the force may be repulsive instead of attractive or the external field may even demagnetize the magnet. In other cases the magnetization of the permanent magnet may increase (up to B sat .) The force and torque equations are different because the magnetized object has a permanent intrinsic magnetization ( B rem ) that is constant in both size and direction independent of the external field ( B ). Assuming the permanent magnet is brought into the field at a fringe field well below N  B rem and is magnetized along its principal axis, we can write Translational force ( F z ) in the z -direction for a permanently magnetized ellipsoid (with B << B rem ) Torque for a permanently magnetized ellipsoid in an external field ( B ) (with B << B rem )", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/forces-on-metal.html"}

Neuronal activity creates a hemodynamic response that locally alters local brain concentrations of deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin. This process, in turn, produces time-dependent alterations in T2- and T2*- relaxation times forming the basis of the BOLD signal. A BOLD pulse sequence should therefore have the following characteristics: 1) sensitivity to T2 and/or T2* changes; 2) ability to detect the intrinsically low BOLD signal, often just a few percent different than baseline; and 3) sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to cover the entire brain at multiple closely spaced time points.

MR contrast agents containing gadolinium (and other metal ions) induce both T1 and T2 relaxation in tissues where they accumulate. This results from dipolar interactions between water nuclei (in tissue) and electron spins at the metallic center. The phenomenon is known as paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). As described in the prior Q&A gadolinium (Gd) exhibits powerful paramagnetism due to its electronic structure, possessing 7 unpaired electrons in its 4f shell. As these inner electrons are not directly involved with bonding, the paramagnetism of Gd is maintained even when formulated as a contrast agent attache to a larger molecule. Electronic structure of the Gd atom A further consequence of this electron structure is that the Gd +3 ion typically exhibits nine coordination sites for bonding and chemical interactions. In all MR contrast agents now commercially available, a ligand group occupies eight of these sites while the ninth is available for transient bonding by a solvent water molecule. This water molecule approaches very close (mean distance ~0.25 nm) to the metallic center, fitting into a crevice of the ligand. These direct and intimate magnetic interactions between water and the Gd +3 ion give rise to a process known as inner sphere relaxation . The powerful paramagnetism of the Gd ion has effects that extend well beyond this inner sphere, however. At a distance of about 0.4-0.5 nm lies another group of water molecules in a so-called second shell . Some of the water molecules in the second shell are transiently bonded to hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of the ligand, while others are just diffusing by. Molecules in the second shell are also in continuous chemical exchange with bulk water much further away. The indirect effects of the Gd ion on this pool is known as outer sphere relaxation . Ball and stick model of the contrast agent Gd-DTPA (Magnevist). The Gd +3 ion is coordinated with 5 oxygen atoms (blue) and 3 nitrogen atoms (red). Structural carbon atoms are black. The crevice in the molecule leaves room for a single water molecule (blue and green) to interact directly with the Gd +3 ion (inner sphere relaxation). Beyond this a second shell of other water molecules experience outer sphere relaxation. Although the paramagnetically-induced static field distortions surrounding the Gd ion are sufficient to induce T2 relaxation, T1 relaxation requires field fluctuations near the Larmor frequency. Such fluctuations occur secondary to thermally-induced tumbling of the Gd-containing macromolecule as well as rotations, collisions, bonding and diffusion of the surrounding water molecules. Dipole-dipole interactions (described in prior Q&A ) between the water protons and the metallic center are primarily responsible for paramagnetic relaxation in the Gd-containing contrast agents now in common use. Biophysical theories describing how paramagnetic contrast agents produce these effects are beyond the scope of this website. Several excellent review articles are provided in the references below for interested readers. From this complex analysis, the following general conclusions can be drawn: 1. Molecular size . For efficient relaxation to occur from the dipolar mechanism, the molecular correlation time (reflecting the rotational rate of the contrast molecule) should have components near the Larmor frequency. Smaller aqueous contrast agents (like Gd-DTPA) tumble too quickly to be highly efficient at relaxation. Larger molecular weight contrast agents will therefore have slightly better relaxivity than smaller ones. If the contrast agent attaches to a very large molecule (such as albumin), its motion slows to a range much closer to the Larmor frequency and its relaxivity increases dramatically. Thus the once commercially available contrast agent Ablavar (which was essentially Gd-DTPA with a ligand modification allowing strong binding to albumin) had a relaxivity 4-5 x higher than simple Gd-DTPA (Magnevist). 2. Inner sphere effects . In the inner sphere, water molecules make a very close approach to the gadolinium center resulting in a powerful dipole-dipole interaction. The magnitude of the inner sphere effect depends on how close an approach of water is allowed by the molecule as well as the number of potential binding sites available. Currently available gadolinium agents have only one inner sphere binding site. The size and shape of the contrast molecule also affects the mean residence time for each water molecule at this site. For most commercially available contrast agents the mean residence time is approximately 1 sec. This translates to a water exchange rate of approximately 1 million times per second. Thus a single gadolinium molecule can affect many, many water protons in a short period of time! 3. Outer sphere effects . Outer sphere relaxation is also dipolar in nature but not as powerful as inner sphere effects on a molecule-by-molecule basis because of the larger distance of these waters from the gadolinium center. Nevertheless, a much larger number of water molecules are exposed to magnetic field fluctuations along the surface of the contrast agent than the single molecule at the inner sphere site. And water in this outer shell can exchange magnetization with others in the bulk water pool more distally. 4. Relative magnitudes of inner and outer sphere effects . The relative contributions of inner and outer sphere effects to total relaxation depend on field strength, the size and type of the contrast agent molecule, and the diffusion rate of water in the surroundings. It is generally believed that for conventional Gd-based contrast agents at clinically relevant field strengths (0.5 - 3.0T) inner sphere and outer sphere contributions are roughly equal. Outer sphere relaxation is more important for smaller contrast agents without protein binding, slow translational diffusion, and lower field strengths. Conversely, inner sphere effects are more important at high fields for slowly rotating systems in the setting of fast translational diffusion. The following educational video may clarify some of these points.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/paramagnetic-relaxation.html"}

During that era, high-field magnets were anything greater than or equal to 1.0T and those in between were considered intermediate- or mid-field. Today, as the marketplace has shifted toward higher and higher fields, the characterizations of magnetic field strength have also changed.

Contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) requires that imaging be initiated at or near the peak time of contrast arrival in the vessel of interest. To estimate the bolus arrival time, (semi)-automated tracking and triggering software are nearly always used. Three basic methods are available: 1) test bolus timing, 2) fluoroscopic triggering, and 3) time-resolved imaging. With test bolus timing a small (1-2 mL) test dose of contrast is first administered. The vessel is often imaged in cross section even if a different primary plane of imaging is used for the MRA itself. A series of rapidly acquired 2D images is then obtained over the next 20-40 seconds. These images are examined to determine the time course for passage of the test bolus with calculation of optimal time delay and imaging window. The MRA sequence is then run using these parameters with administration of the remainder (~18 mL) of the gadolinium contrast. The bolus timing method can be performed even on older scanners and provides direct evidence the IV and injector are functioning properly. Disadvantages include 1) increased imaging time; 2) wasting of a small amount of contrast during the test injections; and 3) background contamination by gadolinium (can be severe in renal collecting system and bladder). In fluoroscopic triggering the full bolus of contrast (~20 mL) is administered while a fluoroscopic-like picture of the artery of interest is acquired using a rapid 2D gradient-echo technique. Arrival of the bolus is detected by increased signal in the \"fluoroscopic\" image. At this time the technologist issues a command to begin the MRA imaging acquisition. The fluoroscopic method offers some advantages in that an experienced technologist can watch the passage of contrast through the heart and proximal vessels to judge to optimal time for imaging to begin. Automatic triggering on bolus arrival can also be performed by placing a region-of interest over the vessel to be imaged. Here the scanner, rather than the technologist, identifies the arrival of the contrast bolus when a specified signal threshold (e.g., 20% above baseline) is exceeded. Once the threshold is reached a programmed delay of 3-4 seconds is interposed to allow the peak bolus to arrive before MRA signal acquisition begins. Automatic triggering of contrast bolus using SmartPrep Some form of automatic bolus detection and triggering software, often combined with fluoroscopic visual tracking is offered by every vendor under a different trade name. GE offers both Smart Prep and Fluoro Trigger ; Philips offers BolusTrak ; Hitachi calls theirs FLUTE (\"FLUoro-Triggered Examination); and Canon offers Visual Prep . Siemens uses the term CARE Bolus , which is an acronym carried over from CT angiography standing for \"Combined Applications to Reduce (radiation) Exposure\". A third method, time-resolved imaging , does not require accurate estimation of the arrival of the contrast bolus. In these techniques, scanning is performed rapidly and repeatedly over the area of interest, with oversampling the central lines of k -space every few seconds. A full dose contrast injection is performed and MR signal acquisition begins a few seconds later. The final set of images constitute a cine display for the evaluation of flow dynamics. The major trade-off for time-resolved methods is between temporal and spatial resolution. Series of time-resolved CE-MRA images Time-resolved CE-MRA techniques include GE's TRICKS and Siemens' TWIST sequences.

The late subacute stage of hematoma evolution is generally considered to last between about 1 week and 2 months after the initial hemorrhage. By the end of the first week, lysis of red blood cells (RBCs) occurs with release of methemoglobin (met-Hb) into the hematoma cavity. As described in a prior Q&A , met-Hb has 5 unpaired electrons and is highly paramagnetic. Additionally, the shape of the crevices within the globin subunits allows close approach of water molecules to the heme ferric (Fe +3 ) centers. The resulting complex is known as aquo-methemoglobin . The direct interaction of H 2 O molecules and heme centers results in inner sphere relaxation with very short T1 values (and corresponding brightness on T1-weighted images). As long as met-Hb continues to be compartmentalized intracellularly, however, local magnetic susceptibility effects persist and the hematoma remains dark on T2/T2*-weighted images. With lysis of RBCs methemoglobin is no longer concentrated into multiple intracellular compartments, but becomes uniformly dispersed throughout the hematoma cavity. There it is mixed/dissolved with water and residual serum components. Local T2/T2*-dephasing effects disappear and the hematoma now becomes bright on T2 weighted images. Above: Imaging characteristics of late subacute hematomas (typical time frame, 1 week - 2 months). During this stage extracellular methemoglobin predominates in the center, with ferritin/hemosiderin deposited at the periphery. Below: MR images obtained about 3 weeks after left basal ganglia hemorrhage illustrating extracellular methemoglobin. Center of hematoma is hyperintense to brain on both T1-weighted (top left) and T2-weighted (top center) images. Center is also hyperintense on T2*-weighted gradient echo image (top right), with prominent low signal at periphery due to ferritin/hemosiderin deposition. Trace DW image (bottom left) shows high signal centrally, reflecting continued diffusion restriction within the increasingly liquified hematoma. Diffusion is indeed restricted compared to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but only minimally or not at all compared to brain. This can be noted on the ADC map (bottom center) where the center of the hematoma is isointense or even slightly higher intensity than brain. Thus the high signal on the trace/DWI image mostly represents a \"T2-shine-through\" effect rather than highly restricted diffusion. Note that both the DWI and ADC images have a dark peripheral ring due to susceptibility effects of ferritin/hemosiderin.

This allows calculation of three velocity vector components: v x , v y , and v z . These components be displayed as separate images using using a gray scale to define direction (superior-to-inferior, left-to-right, or anterior-to-posterior).

The transition from deoxy-Hb to met-Hb thus requires the loss of an electron from each iron center. Paradoxically, met-Hb is slightly more paramagnetic than deoxy-Hb, having 5 unpaired electrons compared to 4 unpaired electrons in deoxy-Hb.

RF spectrum in the range of MRI Click to enlarge Radiofrequency (RF) shielding of an MR scanner is mandatory and serves two functions: 1) to prevent extraneous electromagnetic radiation from contaminating/distorting the MR signal, and 2) to prevent electromagnetic radiation generated by the MR scanner from causing interference in nearby medical devices. As shown in the accompanying table, the frequencies of different strength MRI scanners overlap with those used by various private and commercial communication devices. (As a point of reference, FM radio occupies the band from 88-108 MHz). If your scanner happens to be sited next to a broadcast TV station or home with a ham radio enthusiast, you may be in trouble. But this is rare. The most common form of RF interference comes from noise generated from nearby electrical equipment (transformers, motors, pumps) or electronic devices (computers, pulse oximeters, cardiac monitors). As a rule, most manufacturers require that the magnet room to have at least 100dB of RF attenuation at the Larmor frequency. Specialized construction firms (such as ETS-Lindgren or National MRI Shielding) are generally enlisted in the design and building oversight for the RF-shielded magnet room. The ideal room consists of three nested components: 1) an outer shell for structural support; 2) a middle metallic RF-shield; and 3) an interior layer made of finish materials. The RF-shield must encircle the entire room - walls, floor, and ceiling. Such a conductive box used to shield out stray electromagnetic interference is also known as a Faraday cage . Virtually any type of metal can be used, including aluminum and galvanized steel. However, the most common RF-enclosure consists of wood panels wrapped with copper. At the range of frequencies used for MRI the skin conductive depth for copper is very small (on the order of 0.1 mm), meaning that only a thin layer of metallic shielding is required.

They are applied immediately before the start of an MR imaging sequence. These chemically selective pulses cause the signal from fat to be nulled (saturated) while the water signal is relatively unaffected. The Fat-Sat technique is the most widely used method for fat suppression. The popularity of this method derives from the fact that it is easy to implement, generally effective, and can be used in conjunction with virtually any imaging sequence. A clinical example is shown below. T1-weighted pelvis image without fat-sat. Fat is the brightest substance. T1-weighted image with fat-sat. Note how muscle is now much brighter than subcutaneous fat or bone marrow. The diagram right shows how signals from water and fat protons resonate in two peaks, separated by about 210-220 Hz at 1.5T and 420-440 Hz at 3.0T. The peaks are relatively broad and have slight overlap because of magnetic field inhomogeneities. Because of this natural separation in resonant frequencies, it is possible to saturate the fat peak only by applying a narrow-bandwidth RF-pulse tuned to the center of the lipid resonance. When a standard imaging sequence (SE, GRE, etc) is subsequently performed, the saturated fat protons will not generate an MR signal, resulting in a fat-suppressed image with signal only from water protons. Fat-Sat pulses are part of a group of closely related methods known as spectrally selective suppression . Other substances, such as water or silicone, could be alternatively suppressed by simply tuning the saturating RF-pulse to their specific frequencies. Spectrally selective suppression techniques are often generically referred to as \" Chem Sat \" or CHESS (Chemical Shift Selective) methods. The fat (or water) peak may be selectively saturated by a narrow-bandwidth radiofrequency (RF)-pulse. Fat-Sat pulses on most commercial imagers function according to the general method pictured here. In modern clinical MR imaging, spectral fat suppression is generally performed using a homospoil technique similar to that shown right. First, a short-duration, frequency-selective 90-RF pulse is applied that rotates the fat magnetization into the transverse plane. Immediately thereafter, the fat magnetization is dephased by application of a strong spoiler gradient along one or more axes. This process theoretically leaves only the magnetization of water aligned with the z -axis and available to participate in the ensuing pulse sequence. Typical \"Fat Sat\" pulse and spoiler gradient used in a GRE sequence. On most MR imagers standard fat saturation pulses are sinc-, Gaussian-, or Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR)-shaped with typical bandwidths of 200-250 Hz and pulse durations of 8-15 msec. Because the saturation pulse and the spoiler gradient take up time that would normally be used for signal generation, reduction in the number of slices for a given TR always occurs. This slice penalty may be mitigated by using RF-pulses and spoilers of shorter duration (e.g. Siemens' \" Weak FatSat\" option). Although fat suppression is somewhat compromised, the resultant image may nevertheless prove adequate for clinical purposes. It is also possible to save time by applying the Fat-Sat pulses at intervals less frequently than before every TR interval (e.g. Siemens' \" Quick FatSat\"). However, the time between Fat-Sat pulses cannot be extended longer than about 100 msec, because significant longitudinal recovery of fat will occur in that interval due to its short T1. The effectiveness of a Fat-Sat pulse depends primarily on field strength and field homogeneity. At fields below 0.3T the water and fat peaks are so close together (in Hz) that it is difficult to cleanly suppress one or the other with a chemically selective pulse. At low fields another method of fat suppression (typically STIR or Dixon ) must therefore be used. T2-weighted pelvic image with Fat-Sat. Due to a metallic implant in the hip, failure of fat saturation in a large region of the left pelvis is noted. Spectral fat suppression can prove inadequate even at high fields if magnetic homogeneity is poor. This occurs typically around metal objects, at tissue interfaces with different magnetic susceptibilities, and where significant variations in tissue shape occur. Inhomogeneity effects can be minimized by performing shimming prior to imaging or packing saturation bags around irregularly shaped body parts. In spite of these measures, incomplete fat saturation regularly occurs.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/fat-sat-pulses.html"}

Inversion recovery techniques provide unique image contrasts in three important ways: 1) ability to selectively suppress (\"null\") the signal from any given tissue based on its T1-value; 2) superior discrimination of tissues based on T1 relaxation times; 3) additive (rather than competitive) T1 and T2 effects. Selective Tissue Suppression After the 180-inverting pulse has been applied, the initial longitudinal magnetization ( M z ) of tissues has been flipped into the  z -direction (opposite to B o ). During the inversion time (TI) interval (between this first 180 and 90 pulses), the magnetization of the inverted tissues regrows under T1 relaxation toward the + z -direction. During this process a time occurs where the M z of each tissue passes through zero. If TI is set to that particular value (and signal generation initiated at that point), the tissue passing through zero will produce no signal and be effectively suppressed or \"nulled\". For most tissues the null point typically occurs when TI  0.69 x T1. Up to Twice the Dynamic Range Because of the 180 inverting pulse, tissues in IR undergo T1 relaxation up to twice the dynamic range compared to SE. This means that IR can potentially discriminate among tissues based on subtle differences in T1 characteristics better than SE. This feature is illustrated in the graphs to the right where SE and IR are compared. Different separation of magnetization of two tissues based on T1-relaxation effects at equal times after a 90-pulse in a SE sequence (left) and after the 180-pulse in an IR sequence (right). Additive T1 and T2 contrast Many types of pathology (eg, tumors, infarctions, infections) have elevated T1 and T2 values resulting from increased free water content compared to background tissue. In routine SE imaging T1 generally results in decreased signal intensity while T2 results in increased intensity. In other words, the combined T1 and T2 effects compete with and partially cancel each other in SE imaging. At short to medium TIs, long T1 substances (such as CSF) are bright on magnitude IR. This is opposite to SE where long T1 values cause reduced signal intensity. In IR imaging, however, especially using short to medium TI values, an T1 will result in increased signal intensity that adds to the postive signal effects due to T2. The reason for this is that when TI is less than that at the null point (< 0.69 x T1 ), the magnetization of the long T1 pathology will remain inverted and produce a high signal on magnitude reconstructed IR images. Disadvantages of IR In spite of all these unique features and advantages, there are several disadvantages for IR compared to SE and GRE techniques: Longer scan times Increase in flow-related artifacts Signal-to-noise can decrease as tissues are suppressed Higher specific absorption rate (SAR) due to additional 180 pulses", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/why-use-ir.html"}

If a signal is not sampled using enough data points, its true frequency will be underestimated. This falsely estimated signal will be indistinguishable from (i.e., be an \"alias\" to) another signal having that true lower frequency. To properly measure a signal, the digital sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency contained within that signal . This is known as the Nyquist sampling theorem . The aliasing phenomenon is not confined to MRI but is present in all types of technology, explaining audible distortions of sound, moire patterns in photos, and unnatural motion in cinema.

For conventional MR imaging, gadolinium is imaged at a time when it has relatively low concentration and is distributed widely in the tissue extracellular space. In this environment, T1 shortening effects predominate and gadolinium appears bright on T1-weighted images. In a Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC) study, gadolinium is imaged during its first pass through the vascular space. At this time the concentration of gadolinium is high (often exceeding 2-3 mM).

PACS store the image data, as well as a other demographic and technical information in a format known as DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) . The DICOM standard was developed in 1990's as a joint collaboration between the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). The DICOM file contains a header (that stores patient's name, age, sex, type of scan, image dimensions, etc) as well as all of the image data (that can contain information in three dimensions). The current DICOM standard is widely accepted among major vendors, and for storing and transferring relatively simple image data works very efficiently. Unfortunately, there is no widely accepted DICOM standard for a large number of complex MR data sets, such as those generated using functional MRI, MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging, and the like. This \"unconventional\" raw data is either: 1) \"scrubbed\" (stripped) and not transferred to PACS, or 2) stored in a proprietary format defined by so-called private fields of the DICOM metadata header. Thus it is very common not to be able access or reprocess important functional MR data if only a clinical PACS has been used to store the data obtained.

True FISP is the Siemens trade name for a steady-state coherent sequence in which balanced gradients are used along all three axes. \"Balanced\" means that the net gradient-induced dephasing over a TR interval is zero. Conversely, some of the gradients in FISP and PSIF are unbalanced, allowing recording of separate FID and echo components of the steady-state free precession signal. In True FISP, however, the balanced gradients refocus both components at the exact center of the TR interval as a single echo. Other vendors have similar sequences. GE calls theirs FIESTA (Fast Imaging Employing Steady-state Acquisition) and Philips calls theirs Balanced-FFE (Fast Field Echo) respectively. True FISP . Note symmetric (balanced) gradients along all 3 axes and formation of the echo at the middle of sequence. Is that what makes it \"truer\"? True FISP banding artifacts. Although the principles underlying echo formation in True FISP have long been known, widespread clinical implementation has been slow due to stringent technical requirements. True FISP sequences demand a very high level of magnetic field homogeneity and control over gradient switching and shaping. The refocusing mechanism fails if intravoxel dephasing exceeds 180 manifest by band-like artifacts. During the last decade modern scanners have overcome these limitations making True FISP a viable and useful sequence on most mid- and high-field systems. The signal intensity ( S Bal ) for the balanced (True FISP) sequence is given by When the echo is recorded close to the middle of the interval ( TE  TR/2 , as is usually the case), the final term e TE/T2 depends on T2, not T2*. Thus True FISP sequences behave more like spin echo than gradient echo sequences in that they do not have T2*-dependence. Also, since TR is nearly always much, much shorter than T1 or T2, the exponential terms containing TR can be disregarded and the equation simplified to This is an interesting result. The signal intensity is seen to be directly related to the ratio 1  (T1/T2) = T2/T1 . For most solid tissues, the T2/T1 ratio is small. The exceptions are fat (0.30) and fluids (0.70). Thus True FISP sequences tend to highlight fluids such as CSF and blood, making them ideal for cardiovascular MRI, MR cisternography/myelography, MR urography, and MR enterography. For most True FISP applications where bright T2/T1 signal is desired, TR is chosen to be a short as possible, TE = TR/2 , and flip angle () is set in a moderate to high range (50-80). Low flip angles provide spin density weighted contrast but are seldom used. Long TR values are likewise usually avoided.

Since time-of-flight MR images are T1-weighted and reformatted using a maximum intensity projection (MIP) method, high signal from fat may obscure vessels or mimic pathology. This is particularly problematic at the skull base where abundant fatty marrow may create artifacts around the carotid and vertebral arteries. As such, a number of centers have explored methods to suppress fat through chemical shift (CHESS) , Dixon , or water excitation (WE) techniques. An example using WE is shown below: TOF MRA (conventional). Note high signal from fat in marrow, orbits and subcutaneous tissues. TOF MRA using water excitation.

Zipper-like bands of spurious signal passing through the image result from a variety of causes, so no single maneuver may correct them all. The most common form of zipper artifact passes through the center of the image and is oriented in the phase-encode direction. This type of zipper artifact results from varying transmitter leakage (\"feed-through\") picked up by the receiver system. Perhaps the most common origin of this RF noise is an extraneous source that reaches the receiver coil because the door of the RF shielded scanner room has not been fully closed or its seal is defective. A second common cause is RF emission from anesthesia monitoring equipment (e.g., pulse oximeters) used within the scanner room. Zipper-like artifacts oriented in the frequency-encode direction are usually caused by stimulated echoes from imperfect slice-selection profiles or improper RF-transmitter adjustments. Increasing interslice gap may minimize them, but a call to the service engineer is usually in order. Star artifact (arrow) Zipper artifact due to RF-feedthrough Annefact (cusp) artifact due to stimulated echoes outside FOV The annefact (cusp) artifact closely resembles the zipper artifact in that it is a featherlike ribbon of bright signal smeared through the center of the image in the phase-encode direction. It arises from stimulated echoes picked up outside the FOV by distant array coils that have not been properly deactivated. This artifact is a wrap-around artifact due to gradient non-linearity coupled with a spatially varying main magnetic field near the end of the magnet bore.

The basic anatomy of the visual pathway should be familiar to all neuroscience students: Light enters the eye, stimulating retinal cells, whose integrated output fibers travel along the optic nerves, partially crossing in the optic chiasm, and continuing along the optic tracts to synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Optic radiations emerge from the LGN to terminate on neurons in a specialized region of the occipital lobe  the primary visual cortex also known as the striate cortex or visual area one (V1) . Retinal projections to V1 are highly organized, with each visual field projecting to the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. The most complex integration of visual information occurs in the extrastriate cortex , visual association areas denoted V2V6 located in the adjacent occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. Transmission to these areas occurs along two pathways: a ventral stream thought to be responsible for object recognition and the storage of long-term visual memories, and a dorsal stream associated with the spatial location of objects and perception of motion.

Read MR Safety Disclaimer Before Proceeding Artificial Cardiac Valves Artificial cardiac valves may be implanted by either an open surgical or transcatheter approach. They are classified as either bioprosthetic or mechanical. Bioprosthetic valves are either homografts (made from human tissue) or xenografts (porcine, bovine, equine). Some have no metallic components and are MR Safe at all field strengths. (Their visibility on x-ray is due to admixture of a small amount of barium sulfate to the silicone structure). Others, especially transcatheter ones, have support rings or stents containing titanium, tungsten, or non-ferromagnetic alloys, making them MR Conditional . Because the lifespan of bioprosthetic valves is only 10 to 20 years, they are typically implanted in older patients. Mechanical valves all contain metal (titanium or an alloy) at least in their support structure. Currently available valves have either one or two tilting disks. Older mechanical valves (such as Bj  rk-Shiley or caged-ball models, including some made of stainless steel) may rarely be encountered, but like their modern counterparts are considered MR Conditional. \"MR Safe\", nonmetallic porcine valve for surgical implantation \"MR Conditional\" Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) \"MR Conditional\" Bi-leaflet mechanical valve Annuloplasty and Valve Repair Devices A nnuloplasty is a procedure to tighten, reshape, or reinforce the ring (annulus) around a heart valve.

(From Wikipedia.com) MR Safety Recommendations The results of numerous investigations have demonstrated that metal-containing valves do undergo magnetically induced torques, but the magnitude of this effect is much less than the force exerted by the beating heart itself. This is in part because the metals used in modern mechanical valves (titanium, Elgiloy) are not ferromagnetic. Even very old stainless steel valves are likewise considered of no danger in MRI.

For safety purposes, biomedical implants and devices that might be used in the MRI environment have been classified into three groups since 2005 by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International (Standard F2503-20): MR SAFE The device/implant is non- magnetic, non-conductive, and does not react to MR levels of radiofrequency irradiation. Its presence poses no risk to patients or staff in the MRI environment. MR CONDITIONAL The device /implant does contain magnetic, conductive or RF-reactive components, but is deemed safe for use in the MRI environment provided certain strict conditions are followed. MR UNSAFE The device/implant contains ferromagnetic materials or has such a response to electromagnetic irradiation that it poses potential harm to MRI patients or staff under all circumstances. The terms MR Safe and MR Unsafe are self-explanatory, but MR Conditional encompasses a wide range of implants and devices deemed safe only under limited conditions. Typical conditions may include limits on field strength, field spatial gradient, gradient strength, gradient slew rate, specific absorption rate, and B1+ rms , as shown in the example below Methods for testing implanted devices for conditional use come from ASTM International as well as the International Standards Organization (ISO) . The ASTM standards are rather limited, but include measurement methods for displacement force (F2052), magnetic torque (2213), RF-induced heating (F1282), and imaging artifacts (F2119). The ISO controlling document ( ISO/TS 10974) is much more extensive, incorporating/referencing the ASTM standards, as well as describing more detailed protocols for RF/gradient-heating, gradient-induced vibrations, gradient-induced electric fields, and device malfunction. These methods and standards will be the source of several subsequent Q&A's. The single most reliable source to find out whether a given biomedical implant can be safely scanned, or if so, under what conditions, is the manufacturer's website . In doing such a search, it is essential to know the precise name and model of the implant, and in some cases, even the device serial number. Two widely used general information sites that provide guidance are MRISafety.com . Developed by my colleague, physiologist Frank Shellock, MRISafety.com provides a wealth of general and specific knowledge concerning MR safety with copious references. One of the sections is titled \"The List\", where over 5000 individual implants and devices are listed and categorized. Frank has further subdivided the ASTM's MR Conditional category into 8 Subtypes, which I personally don't use but may be helpful to some. Finally, like my own website, MRISafety.com is entirely free to use and does not require registration or log-on. MagResource.com . Developed by an MR technologist, Jan Gardner, MagResource.com is the most comprehensive site available, with information on over 20,000 items. There are direct links to nearly all device manufacturers, and they claim that if your implant isn't listed in their database they will research it and hunt it down for you.

The accuracy of phase-contrast methods varies by size and location of imaged vessel. In general phase-contrast measurements correlate well with other techniques including Doppler and indicator dilution methods. Several limitations and caveats are warranted, however: Angled Imaging plane . Measurement of flow velocities is most accurate when the vessel is perpendicular to the plane of imaging and through-plane flow-encoding is used. Deviations of up to 15 are tolerable but beyond this, significant errors can occur. Inadequate Temporal resolution . If the data sampling rate throughout the cardiac cycle is too low, flow may not be measured at its peak value. The average velocity will then be underestimated. For imaging the great vessels at least 16 frames per cardiac cycle should be sampled, with standard values of 30 being optimal. Inadequate Spatial resolution . When the pixel size exceeds one-third of the vessel diameter, significant partial volume effects may occur with underestimation of flow and peak velocities. This is not a problem for larger vessels like the aorta, but is an important issue for smaller structures like the coronary arteries or cerebral aqueduct whose diameters may be 2-3 mm or less. Irregular or Turbulent Flow . Phase contrast pulse sequences are optimized for linear (non-accelerated) flow. When velocities change suddenly in magnitude, direction, or both, accuracy of flow measurements declines. Magnetic Field Inhomogeneities . Because flow velocities are computed from phase changes, any process that causes systemic phase offsets across the field-of-view will produce measurement errors. Magnetic field inhomogeneities due to susceptibility effects, gradient non-uniformities, or eddy currents may lead to either underestimation or overestimation of flows. Automated subtraction and phase-correction techniques may improve the results, and manual shimming is sometimes needed.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/how-accurate.html"}

If gapless imaging is desired, then two separate interleaved acquisitions may be employed. Slice interleaving to allow contiguous slices without cross-talk.

Siemens specifies the slice gap indirectly, calling it the \"distance factor\". Siemens' \"distance factor\" is specified as a percentage of slice thickness rather than actual distance.

Wrap-around, a form of aliasing , is a phenomenon fundamental to digital signal processing and can theoretically occur in both the phase-encode or frequency-encode directions. The basis for this phenomenon is illustrated in the diagram right, where a high frequency signal is inadequately sampled and thereby misinterpreted as a signal of lower frequency. This mismapping of high frequencies into a lower part of the spectrum is can produce spatial ambiguity in the MR image and a \"fold-over\" or \"wrap-around\" artifact. To avoid frequency aliasing, digital sampling of the MR signal must be performed at least twice as rapidly as the highest frequency expected. This critical sampling rate is known as the Nyquist frequency . If the signal is sampled less frequently than the Nyquist limit, a misassignment of higher frequencies as lower frequencies will occur. Unlike aliasing in the phase-encode direction, aliasing in the frequency-encoding direction is not usually a problem in modern clinical MR imaging. This is because frequency aliasing is largely eliminated by two methods: 1) signal oversampling and 2) bandpass filtering before the image is reconstructed. Oversampling means that more data measurements of the MR signal are performed than required for image display resolution. In most modern MR scanners, the MR signal is sampled 512-1024 times per echo (even though the display resolution in the frequency-encode direction is usually taken to be 256). In other words, the Nyquist sampling rate is 2-4 times the highest frequency in the signal. Because this task is accomplished by merely increasing the digitizing rate of the sampling circuitry, it imposes essentially no time penalty and occurs \"invisibly\". A 2x level of frequency oversampling is performed by default on most MR scanners, though the oversampling factor may be adjustable. Vendor-specific terms for this method include \"frequency oversampling\" (Siemens, Philips, Hitachi), \"anti-aliasing\" (GE), and \"frequency-wrap suppression\" (Canon). Bandpass filtering is an analog, digital, or hybrid method by which spurious high-frequency components are eliminated. The filter \"passes\" through all frequency components in a desired band, but attenuates/rejects frequencies outside of the chosen range. As a result of oversampling and filtering of the raw MR signal before image reconstruction occurs, aliasing in the frequency-encoding direction is essentially imperceptible in modern MRI.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/frequency-wrap-around.html"}

Deshielding of the H nuclei of water C hemical shift refers to small changes in resonant frequency due to different molecular environments of nuclei. The H protons of fat, for example, are nestled within long-chain triglycerides and covered by electron clouds. These clouds partially shield the fat protons from the full effects of an externally applied magnetic field. The H protons of water, however, are less shielded because their electron clouds are pulled away from them by the highly electronegative oxygen atom. Because of this differential shielding by electron clouds, a fat proton experiences a slightly weaker local magnetic field and will resonate at a slightly lower frequency than a nearby water proton. The difference in frequencies is extremely small, on the order of 3.4 parts per million (ppm) or 3.4 x 10 -6 . At 1.5 T this corresponds to an absolute frequency difference of approximately 215 Hz. At 3.0 T the difference is twice as large, or about 430 Hz. In routine MR imaging, spatial position is assigned along the frequency-encode direction on the basis of resonant frequency. If both water and lipid protons coexist in a voxel, the signal emitted by the lipid protons will have a lower frequency than that of the water protons. Consequently, if the system frequency is set to water, the signal from the lipid protons will appear to have arisen from water protons from another voxel in a lower part of the field . When image intensities are assigned in the final image, therefore, the location of fat protons will be spatially mismapped toward the lower part of the readout gradient field. This mismapping of fat and water pixels results in artifactual white or dark bands, one-to-several pixels in width, on either side of an anatomic object. The artifact is most commonly seen around water-containing structures (liver, kidneys, optic nerves, thecal sac, muscles, nerve fascicles) surrounded by fat. Note in the image below a black band is seen on the left side of each kidney and a white band on the right. The side on which the black band appears depends on whether the the frequency-encoding gradient is increasing or decreasing from left-to-right across the image. In the kidney, knee, and leg examples shown, frequency increases from left-to-right. The image of the thecal sac is an exception; it has frequency decreasing from left-to-right. Hence the dark chemical shift band appears to the left of the thecal sac. Chemical shift artifact between spinal fluid and epidural fat Chemical shift artifact at border of muscle and fat A very subtle form of chemical shift occurs at the edges of bones where fatty marrow abuts a water-containing joint capsule or intervertebral disk artifactually altering the apparent cortical thickness. Above: Subtle chemical shift artifact in the knee. Frequency encoding is L to R. Apparent differences in cartilage thickness are artifactual, arising from a shift of marrow fat signal. Right: A similar subtle artifact in the spine. Frequency-encode direction is S-to-I. Differential cortical thickness of vertebrae is artifactual due to chemical shift between marrow and disc. The size of the chemical shift artifact can be readily computed in advance based on two parameters selected prior to imaging: receiver bandwidth and size of the frequency-encode matrix. For example, if the total receiver bandwidth selected is 32 kHz and with 256 pixels in the frequency-encode direction, the bandwidth per pixel is 32,000/256 = 125 Hz. Since the fat-water frequency difference at 1.5 T is about 215 Hz, the size of the chemical-shift artifact will be (215 Hz)  (125 Hz/pixel) = 1.7 pixels. Reducing the bandwidth per pixel will accentuate this artifact. Narrow bandwidth techniques should therefore generally be avoided in locations where chemical-shift artifacts may obscure important interfaces (for instance, between the optic nerve and orbital fat). Because the chemical-shift artifact is a spatial mismapping of MR signal based on frequency, it will typically be seen in the frequency-encode direction. (An exception occurs in echo-planar imaging, where chemical shift artifacts are commonly seen in the phase-encode direction. See the next Q&A ). Additionally, in 2DFT imaging, recall that slice selection is defined by variations in frequency. In this method of acquisition, chemical shift artifacts may occur not only within a plane of imaging, but also between slices (i.e., in the slice-select direction). Inter-slice chemical-shift artifacts may appear as dark or light \"halos\" around certain anatomic structures; others are less obvious and result in subtle degradation of image quality. Finally, one should be aware that chemical-shift artifacts occur not only between water and fat, but at the interface of any two substances having different chemical shifts. For example, the chemical shift between silicone oil (used in ophthalmology) and water is ~4.4 ppm; between silicone gel (in breast prostheses) and water is ~4.7 ppm. Thus chemical shift artifacts may be seen in locations like the breast, head and neck, and extremities where silicone injections or implants are commonly used.

It refers to the low signal seen in vessels that contain vigorously flowing blood and is generally synonymous with vascular patency. Flow voids can also be seen with active flow or pulsations of other fluids, like CSF or urine. The origin of the \"flow void\" signal loss is a combination of time-of-flight and spin-phase effects, described more completely in separate Q&A's. Why don't I use the term or like it? It creates confusion for many non-radiologists. Flow voids seen in the basilar and left internal carotid arteries consistent with vascular patency. No flow void is seen in the right internal carotid consistent with extremely slow flow or occlusion. I believe that the fundamental purpose of an imaging report is to communicate clearly with the referring health care provider. Although radiologists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, and vascular surgeons are quite familiar with the term \"flow void\", many health care providers are not. If you ask a random physician, nurse, or medical student unfamiliar with the details of MR imaging what a \"flow void\" means, you will likely receive an answer along the lines of \"It means an absence of flow.\" This, of course, is exactly the opposite to the true meaning of the term. So why use words in your report that are potentially confusing to your referring health care providers? Instead of saying, \"A flow void is noted in the basilar artery,\" I dictate, \"Normal flow-related signal loss is present in the basilar artery.\" I know I am not going to win this battle, but it never hurts to try!", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/flow-void.html"}

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are based around a 90-180 architecture to which a pair of pulsed diffusion gradients (DG's) have been added. Image acquisition takes place near the time of the spin echo, which is typically at TE = 60-120 msec. The signal intensity ( S DWI ) for such a sequence can be written as DW sequence is based on spin echo where k is a scaling constant, TR, TE , and b are operator-selected parameters, [ H ] is spin density, and ADC is the apparent diffusion coefficient. The TR value used for most DWI sequences is extremely long (8-10 sec), so the ( 1e TR/T1 ) term may be disregarded. This equation explicitly demonstrates that the signal intensity of a Trace-DW image is directly related to T2 and inversely related to ADC. Lesions that restrict diffusion (strokes, abscesses, etc.) lower the ADC and appear bright. Conversely, substances with unrestricted diffusion and high ADC's (like cerebrospinal fluid) appear dark. The take-home point is that Trace DW images are both diffusion- and T2-weighted. Lesions that have very long T2-values may appear bright even though they do not restrict diffusion. This phenomenon, illustrated below, is known as \"T2 shine-through\". Whenever a bright lesion is encountered on a Trace DW image, the ADC map should be inspected to look for a corresponding area of low signal (restricted diffusion). Such lesions will also appear very bright on conventional T2-weighted images serving as a further confirmatory finding. Trace DW image ADC Map T2-weighted SE image Rounded left parietal lesion (a glioma) shows moderate brightness on Trace DW image. This is not due to restricted diffusion, however, as the lesion is also bright on the ADC map (implying increased diffusivity). The T2-weighted SE image confirms the brightness on the Trace image is a T2 \"shine-through\" effect.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/t2-shine-through.html"}

Are there other ways to achieve this effect? In the 1990's considerable research efforts were devoted to the use of double- and triple-dose (0.2 and 0.3 mmol/kg) gadolinium contrast for detecting brain lesions. Higher dose contrast was associated with greater degrees of enhancement, improved conspicuity, and increased confidence in the detection of small lesions. This could be especially important in the evaluation of intracranial metastatic disease where exact number of metastases had important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Several drug companies (Berlex, Bracco) conducted clinical trials to prove the safety and effectiveness of high-dose contrast for routine use. Due to the higher costs associated with triple-dose regimens as well as increase in flow-related artifacts, the widespread use of high-dose contrast never materialized. Whatever interest remained was further squelched in the late 2000's with the recognition that high-doses of gadolinium might place patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) is an alternative method for obtaining increased conspicuity of enhancement using only a single dose of contrast. MTI uses off-frequency RF-pulses to saturate the \"bound pool\" of macromolecules. Because contrast enhancement is due to a direct water-gadolinium interaction and not mediated by macromolecules, it is not affected by the MT pulse. Contrast enhancing areas are rendered more conspicuous on MT images, rivaling that of triple dose contrast. Brain metastases seen on single dose, single dose with 15-minute delay, single dose with MT, and triple dose contrast. A second lesion (red arrow) is apparent only on the triple dose and MT images. Unfortunately, MTI has never caught on because the images appear noisy and they are commonly affected by \"shine-through\"-like artifacts from other short T1 or long T2 lesions. Both precontrast and postcontrast MT images must be acquired to assure that one is really seeing contrast enhancement rather than one of these artifacts.", "url": "https://mriquestions.com/triple-dose-and-mt.html"}
